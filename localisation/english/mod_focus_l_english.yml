 MON_refuge_from_war_desc:0 "There is war and slaughter rippling across asian nations. We will open our borders to welcome in refugees. They will get shelter, work and a select few will be permitted to serve in our armed forces to keep us safe. If it comes to it, they might be able to take vengeance."
 MON_war_refuge_tt:0 "This focus will give you manpower and state population for each asian nation that is at war."
 MON_continue_modernisation_desc:0 "We will continue the modernisation of our army as started by the former general chief commander Gelegdorjiin Demid, being stuck in the path would not serve us well. We refuse to become such a medieval mess like the Boxer Uprising."
 MON_modern_infantry_desc:0 "On the modern battlefield, infantry will have to hold and attack in rapidly changing and challenging scenarios. We will teach our sergeants and troopers how to adequately respond in stressful situations and how to make the most of them. This way our infantry will be prepared and ready, eager to spring a devestating counterattack."
 MON_supported_infantry_desc:0 "Mere rifles and bullets don't finish wars alone, anymore. We will need to support our infantry with great guns. Piercing the sky, bombarding from above or blowing through tanks. Equipment is the most vital part of a soldier's arsenal."
 MON_modern_warfare_desc:0 "Our army is ready for any modern conflict, moving swiftly and professionally eliminating any resistance before it. Our tanks will roll over countless enemy trenches and destroy their fortifications as if it was nothing. Opposition will be futile in the face of the forces of [MON.GetLeader]!"
 MON_higher_standards_desc:0 "All around us are nations with armies being used as disposable fodder. In China when there is a small conflict, millions die. We can not afford this, so we will hold our generals and army to a higher standard. No lives will be thrown away in vain and every dead Mongol will have to be justified in direct positive effect."
 MON_advanced_army_technology_desc:0 "Our army is being picked up out of a slump, but it is time to start moving onto the cutting edge. Howitzers larger than life, great bunker systems, artillery as large as a flat, tanks as big as a Mongolian village. All you can dream of and more; we will build."
 MON_modernize_stockpile_desc:0 "A lot of what we have in our stockpiles are barely functioning old Soviet weapons from a long time ago, some even from the time the Russian Empire existed. We will have to produce modern arms to replace these relics of the past. And don't worry, we'll fix these relics up and keep them in reserve, just in case."
 MON_faster_forces_desc:0 "Motorizing our armed personnel will allow us to rapidly respond to minor rebellions, and deserters on a small scale. On a larger scale this will allow us to overrun enemy positions."
 MON_a_mongol_tank_desc:0 "Due to our history with the Soviets we have some licenses to build tanks, but we want to develop our own. We will take their tanks as a starting point and make them faster, better armored, with bigger guns. Tanks that embody our great state."
 MON_mongolian_tank_force_desc:0 "Now that we have developed our tank technology we will start forming Mongolian tank divsions and train them relentlessly to break through enemy lines and encircle their troops. These armored divisions will support our troops as an elite striking force."
 MON_altay_mountain_training_desc:0 "Mongolia has three major mountain ranges, the highest is the altay mountains which stretch across the west and southwest regions. We will train our infantry here to the highest level and have them train to employ mountain cannons."
 MON_invite_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "There's many in foreign lands that have dedicated their lives to inventing military doctrines and pushing their idea of how an army should look like. We will invite them and allow them to form a think tank that will advise us on how to reform our doctrines for our navy, army and airforce."
 MON_scavenge_arms_desc:0 "There's no reason to leave all that equipment with the corpses of our enemies. We will instruct our troops to take whatever they can carry at the end of the battle and bring it to their quartermasters. The quartermasters will convert small arms to calibers that we normally use and convert artillery and tanks to use shells we produce."
 MON_traditional_warfare_desc:0 "There's a reason modernizing is sometimes called getting on 'the bleeding edge'. Like a knife, experimentation can cut deep. We will instead focus on proven methods from our own history and that of our neighbours."
 MON_support_cavalry_desc:0 "Sure we have a long history of cavalry, but horses don't do too well in all terrains. For terrain like the gobi desert we have camels and we have learned to produce bicycles for some other places. We shall form these into military units that will able to fight where horses could not. At the same time we will train our cavalry to the highest degree of professionalism."
 MON_great_war_infantry_desc:0 "The great war brough in a large amount of new technologies and techniques. We haven't implemented many of them because we were not in that fight. The heroes that haven't been martyred will get some additional pay to do the speeches we write for them."
 MON_enshrine_war_heroes_desc:0 "Our generals, flying aces, even the humble soldier sacrificing himself for his squad. These military heroes are the core of the myth of our army. Making sure everyone knows about them will give everyone someone to look up to and emulate."
 MON_artillery_investment_desc:0 "To destroy our enemy with a projectile they can't shoot down, with our people far away, is the perfect weapon. We will steer our research to assure we are on the cutting edge of this wonderful technology."
 MON_great_size_cannons_desc:0 "After revamping our railway system we can now support giant train track guided artillery pieces. We've gotten our hands on an old one from the Soviets. While they are only to be guided on tracks, their shells are huge and can support our infantry. We will have to compensate for our lack of a modern fighting force, after all. Nothing else..."
 MON_increased_conscription_desc:0 "We need more people for the army, we will start conscripting great swathes of our men. This will come with a propaganda campaign to try and lessen the amount of forceful conscripting we need to do."
 MON_glorious_army_desc:0 "Our army has been reformed and reconstructed to be able to beat off and beat down any enemy. With the pounding of huge cannons that are able to calculate perfectly where to shoot due to gained intel, our troops will mow down whoever opposes us."
 MON_protect_from_the_threat_desc:0 "We are a small nation with only a couple of hundred thousand people in it. To assure we don't needlessly throw away lives we will erect great forts in which they will be able to mow down wave after wave of enemy soldiers."
 MON_supplying_troops_desc:0 "Our troops need a lot to keep going. Food, small arms ammunition, large shells, uniforms, shovels, new boots, water, pornography, drugs and other medicine. Getting all of this to the soldier and also having the soldier be thoroughly supplied in the first place is paramount! We will revamp our supply system to accomodate this."
 MON_scout_corps_desc:0 "Our military needs intel to know what to do, where and when. Using scout planes will allow us to know the enemy's movements. An informed soldier is a dangerous soldier."
 MON_ground_support_desc:0 "To our men on the ground, planes equipped to assist them are like angels. We will invest plenty to make sure rockets, bombs and other tools are equipped to our close air support planes to destroy the enemy from above and save our troops."
 MON_long_range_aircraft_desc:0 "There's plenty of situations where there's no allied airbase near the frontline, we will develop aircraft capable to support our troops and wage war from far away. No enemy will be beyond our range."
 MON_expand_aviation_institutes_desc:0 "We will expand our aviation institutes to include women, younger men and naturalised Mongols. People regardless of where they come from will be able to pilot these mighty machines and rain death upon our enemies."
 MON_intensify_pilot_training_program_desc:0 "Due to the lack of experienced pilots, we will have to increase funding to and pressure on our pilot training program. We may not have any aces or veterans, but trained pilots that know their left from their right will be a good start."
 MON_pilots_against_revolts_desc:0 "There's enough people, tribes and minorities, that are unhappy with how we do things here. Regardless of how they get their hands on their silly little rifles, our airforce will bomb them from the sky."
 MON_research_modern_navies_desc:0 "As a nation with a couple of great rivers we know what boats are, but the great navies of the foreign lands intrigue us. There's great navies on the pacific oceans, American, Japanese and Soviet. At least one of them might allow us to gain a little insight."
 MON_invest_in_dockyards_desc:0 "We will have to construct great dockyards to support our future goals in the pacific and beyond. These great places of employment will create our mighty fleet, ship by ship."
 MON_stockpile_fuel_desc:0 "We will have to be able to support our army and airforce for quite a while, even after war commences. Armed conflicts make export and import quite difficult. Fuel too will have to stockpiled and stored en masse."
 MON_mongolian_merchant_ships_desc:0 "Every nation with access to the sea needs a merchant navy. This way we can import and export goods and properly levy tariffs. Convoys are vital for that."
 MON_mongolian_marines_desc:0 "Our armed forces need to be properly trained if we want to be able to strike from our coast into other asian lands. If we could do that we can strike from our lands into Japan, China, eastern Soviet Union lands. Maybe even Indochina, Indonesia, or India."
 MON_the_old_school_desc:0 "We see no need to reinvent the wheel, great big ships with giant cannons is how it's done and that is what we'll make."
 MON_capital_ship_focus_desc:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has seen on a rare excursion to foreign lands how great capital ships can be used to bully weaker and smaller nations into submission. Pledging to never let that happen to Mongolia, it's been decided to focus on creating a ship like this for our navy."
 MON_carrier_focus_desc:0 "We are intrigued by the concept of airplane carriers. Great big ships that serve as mobile airports, allowing us to bomb enemy ships and units with impunity. [MON.GetLeader] has decided that this will be our focus for the navy."
 MON_carrier_fighters_desc:0 "We will need to develop planes that can go on the carriers we are planning. They will be able to strike far and land back safely on our steel behemoths."
 MON_khan_class_ships_desc:0 "Great mighty ships, with cannons bigger than buildings, are being created in our dockyard. These heavy ships will strike fear in the heart of even the most hardened enemy naval man."
 MON_prioritize_the_eagle_class_desc:0 "With our airfleet developed and ready, we will focus on getting these hunters into the air from the sea. Two great carriers will be commisioned to harass our foes across the ocean."
 MON_the_new_way_desc:0 "We've read much about lumbering battleships and heavy cruisers, this to us sounds like an easy way to bankrupt ourselves with haste."
 MON_undersea_combat_desc:0 "Our fresh and new fleet is too small to contend with large empires from a world away. We will need to focus on creating a fleet of underwater raiders that will slowly sap these behemoths of strength. The humble submarine is a perfect fit for a nation such as ours."
 MON_cruiser_submarines_desc:0 "Some of our enemies will be assaulting us from afar. We will need to sink their troop transports before they're well and far out of ports. A special type of submarine will be made, loaded with provisions and arms and be sent on the deep crusade into enemy waters."
 MON_midget_submarines_desc:0 "While our state will need to project power in the oceans, we can't afford to endlessly keep pouring resources into some fleet that might never be relevant. We will build small and cheap submarines to project threat on our shores without bankrupting ourselves."
 MON_surface_combat_desc:0 "Unfortunately we can't only hide under the waves. Some ships will have to escort our convoys from enemy submarines and other threats. Our destroyers will be these escorts that will bring our supply routes great safety."
 MON_improved_screen_ships_desc:0 "Some bigger ships will need to be constructed to protect our shores from naval bombardment. The coastal defense fleet will consist of cruisers that will lay in wait for a foolish fleet to get too close."
 MON_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "We will have to rapidly develop a coherent and comprehensive naval doctrine for in which manner we deploy this fleet we are developing. A fleet without the knowledge to use it will sink. Some of our young admirals will be assigned to develop one. "
 MON_mongolian_uranium_desc:0 "We have found a weird resource in our lands, deep underground. When we told the Soviets about this long ago, they were pretty giddy about it. Sure the machines they sent us for research do make a ticking sound when we bring them close to this green rock. Is that good? We'll find out soon enough." 
 MON_royal_guard_desc:0 "The Keshik, the 'favored' were were the imperial guard and shock troops for Mongol royalty in the Mongol Empire, particularly for rulers like Genghis Khan. We will reestablish this organisation. Instead of just being day bodyguard and night bodyguard we will give them positions in important military operations in our country."
 MON_state_police_desc:0 "We will need to secure our streets, people and organisations. Our state police has been established but will need to be given extensive executive powers to do their work and assure the loyalty of all."
 MON_secure_interests_desc:0 "Within our state we have organisations and companies that have considerable power; political or economical. We will stage a great operation to assure their loyalty to the state and to remind them that they are not beyond our reach. They will do our bidding or be destroyed."
 MON_one_leader_desc:0 "There's only one leader of our government. That position comes with power and perks that are well earned by such a powerful leader. [MON.GetLeader]'s strong hand has led us to glory and victory, and he shall do so forevermore!"
 MON_modern_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Modern Mobile Warfare"
 MON_ambitions_achieved_desc:0 "Our empire now spreads through much of Asia, the people once more united against western influence and under a strong Mongol leader. [MON.GetLeader]'s popularity is surging even further as we consolidate our holdings and prepare for the future. A future that, according to our great leader, will be as glorious as the empire of Ghengis from long ago."
 MON_deepened_security_desc:0 "Enemies have been shown to not only come from foreign lands but also from deep within. We will implement a state intelligence agency to keep us safe from without but mostly from within. This might possibly make Soviet interference a little harder as well, but it is vital to secure our rule from any threat."
 MON_help_the_spanish_desc:0 "Assisting our idealogical allies across the world is the duty of any member of an international movement such as communism. We will defend Spain against the onslaught of the fascist uprising in the name of solidarity and the worker's liberation!"
 MON_request_payment_desc:0 "Unfortunately we have to remind the Spanish that help is rarely ever free. While we might not have obtained the Spanish gold reserves, our currency has been based on silver in the past. Obtaining the Spanish silver will assist the Mongol state bank greatly."
 MON_purchase_buryatia_desc:0 "Buryats are a Mongolic ethnic group, sure they speak their own language but they will be glad to be returned to our lands. We strive to be a home for all Mongols, far and wide. If we haven't done any heinous things against their people, they should cooperate with us just fine."
 MON_fate_of_the_chairman_of_the_council_of_ministers_desc:0 "The chairman of the council of ministers, the said naryn zövlöl is our equivalent to the prime minister, and is the head of government. This position should, at any time, be a secure one within our government. With a steady hand and strong rule, without any major infighting."
 MON_invite_tanna_tuva_desc:0 "The USSR and us are the only nations in the world to formally recognise the Tuvan People's Republic. While we see Soviet influence in the nation rising, the Tuvans are a Turkic people with quite a present Mongol minority. Their workers would be more understood and united with us then our Russian brethren. We will reach out to [TAN.GetLeader] and offer them a union."
 MON_connect_the_infrastructure_desc:0 "In our union we wish not to be two seperate nations under one umbrella. We'll connect our industry and railways to make sure our people can freely work and integrate with one another. Tuvan people are now liberated workers in the People's Republic of Mongolia."
 MON_support_the_fight_desc:0 "All over the world, the fight for the liberation of the proletariat rages on. While we can't have boots on the ground in every conflict, we sure as hell can make sure a shipment of Mongolian rifles and some support equipment finds their way there. There's no need to thank us, we just need you to win and install a government of the people, for the people."
 MON_secure_the_administration_desc:0 "After all this upheaval we have to make sure there are no further dissidents, spies or seperatists in our administration. We will make sure everyone is loyal to [MON.GetLeader], no matter what."
 MON_intervene_in_the_region_desc:0 "There's a lot of tension, chaos and conflict in asia at the moment. Both large and smaller fights are breaking out. We might need to get involved in all of this to secure the liberty of the worker and secure our future."
 MON_liberate_the_chinese_desc:0 "Mao has some interesting ideas for someone who claims to be a communist. We believe Sheng Shicai to be the leader of the communist Chinese, and as his primary allies we are privy to claims on the entirety of China. The lands shall unite with us like the Yuan with old, but while that empire brought oppression and crimes against humanity, we will bring the uplifting of the worker's class."
 MON_divide_spheres_desc:0 "There already is a communist organisation in the south that is closely tied to the Chinese. It's probably better to establish diplomatic ties with them, if we are to agree on spheres of influence we could divide up the land in Asia to suit both our goals. While we do not trust Mao and his generals, we are aligned idealogically and should band together to liberate the Chinese people from fascist and imperialist forces."
 MON_free_the_south_desc:0 "In the south there lies a theocracy, a monarchy and all kinds of other imperialist dictatorship. We will dismantle the systems of their oppression and let the liberation of their proletarians commence. Through force if we have to."
 MON_soviet_cooperation_desc:0 "Working with the USSR is in our best interests, they dwarf us in military, political and industrial might. Regardless of how some of our people feel or felt about them, there is value in obtaining a peek under the hood of this communist machine."
 MON_lessons_soviet_army_desc:0 "There is much to learn from the red army, it is a large and well established force in the region with years of experience. We've also relied on them heavily when freeing ourselves of the khanate. Our government has opted to invite advisors and a few units to teach and drill our units. These new insights will serve us well."
 MON_fight_imperialism_desc:0 "to do"
 MON_siberian_project_desc:0 "Siberia is a wasteland, but it is one filled with proud people. Mongolic people, ethnic Siberians, Russians and more. We will work together with the Soviet Union to make sure this land will be able to actually support the people who live there. To create an environment worthy of the Union of Soviet Republics. We will put our people to work to improve infrastructure, set up supply hubs, and connect railways."
 MON_break_with_stalin_desc:0 "The creation of one man totalitarian police states and the theory of socialism in one country is just an another excuse to create a grand empire. [MON.GetLeader] has declared we will not sit around and wait to be incorperated into this disgusting excuse of worker liberation through worker oppression. This might come as a shock to our northern neighbour, but enough is enough."
 MON_state_farms_desc:0 "The sangiin aj akhui, state farms, were established in 1922 and their number has slowly been increasing over the years. As we develop large-scale grain and vegetable farming and import industrialized farming methods their numbers will sky rocket and secure a steady supply of food to be distributed by the state."
 MON_negdels_nokhorlols_desc:0 "We have recently replaced the forced collective farms and communes by production associations, called negdels in mongolian, and nökhörlöls which are voluntary cooperatives. In this manner the workers can pool their resources, influence and needs. This allows them to benefit from economy of scale and allows them to retain economic synergy."
 MON_communist_volunteers_desc:0 "People from across the world have flocked to our righteous banner. We are setting up foreign volunteer divisions as we in turn send volunteers across the world to intervene in the imperialist fight on the side of the just."
 MON_regional_ambitions_desc:0 "We have already secured some of our neighbours and are ready to take our place in the world stage as a modern and powerful communist state. Our ambition is to become the primary communist state in Asia. Combining the pan-asian movements with the liberation of the proletariat will allow us to powerfully propel ourselves towards dominating the region."
 MON_fair_representation_desc:0 "To assure the representation of minority groups we will reconfigure the Khural from an advisory body into a ruling body of state. This way all workers will be united in our state and there will be no favouritism. We will use this to quell resistance and align all towards our ambitions of a united Asian state."
 MON_mongol_empire_tt:0 "This focus will unlock the decision to recreate the Mongol Empire and grant you wargoals on the current owners of the required states."

 MON_asian_federation:0 "The Asian Federation"
 MON_asian_federation_desc:0 "An idea has arisen, instead of subjugating our fellow asian peoples we would like to band together and rise as one. By lifting each other up in one big Asian Federation, we can defend ourselves from any imperialist who tries to impose their will on us. Eastern or western ones, we will be safe."
 MON_lobby_imperialists_desc:0 "We know from experience that being a democracy comes with the weight of some pretty heavy ideals. We should strive to remind the great powers of the world about their ideals of liberty and democracy, the choice of the people."
 MON_centra_tt:0 "Your byproduct will be integrated into your industry spirit and both will gain buffs to create the centralized industry idea."
 MON_lobby_imperialists_effect_tt:0 "This focus will unlock decisions to give Asian puppets and colonies a spirit that gives them democratic growth and ticking autonomy. The overlord needs to be unaligned or a democracy."
 MON_asian_fed:0 "This focus will allow you to request to integrate Asian democracies that are in your faction."

#descs
 TIB_the_ratification_of_the_thirteenth_desc:0  "The ratification of the reincarnation of thirteenth dalai lama is done with the approval of the central government of China. Exempted from the lot-drawing process using the Golden Urn we have now a very young boy as our leader. His regent will have to steer our country until his ascendancy."
 TIB_advisors_to_the_dalai_lama_desc:0  "The young dalai lama has to be guided properly, groomed to become a great spiritual and physical leader. Many advisors will attend him, both biological family and wise men from close and far. We will have to pick the tutors wisely, for the wrong men can create a wrong man."
 TIB_truly_worthy_successor_desc:0  "With the unification of Greater Tibet our leader has proven himself a worthy successor to the thirteenth dalai lama. Our forces triumphant and our people adoring, this newfound popularity will allow us to cement our rule."
 TIB_the_regent_desc:0 "The Regent has been accused by critics of the of widespread corruption, and involvement with married women as a monk. This is clearly a horrid situation and we will have to assure the mind of the young dalai lama is not tainted. Wether it is the truth or a story, we will assure that only whatever is best for Tibet will happen."
 TIB_effective_government_desc:0  "With our army once more loyal and effective, our leader loyal and well advised. We are now an effective and modern theocracy. A noble has approached us to join us in this great time."
 TIB_improve_tibet_desc:0  "Tibet is no geat and modern nation, but we will work hard to make it so. Infrastructure and bureaucracy will need to be reformed to fit our leader and people's needs."
 TIB_secure_tibet_desc:0  "We will not allow Tibet to bend the knee to imperialist from east, west, south or north. Fortifications will sprawl our borders and nothing beneath the sky will disturb our peace."
 TIB_influence_bhuddists_nearby_desc:0  "There are nations around us filled with faithful bhuddists. By allowing ourselves to reach out to them and lobby for support, our govenment will be able to project considerable diplomatic reach into these local politics."
 TIB_religious_tensions_desc:0  "Rising religious tensions have caused us to gain considerable friction with the so far 'independent' minor nations surrounding us. In the sphere of India, we will raeach out to seek agreement in their rulership. The faithful should return to the flock."
 TIB_intervene_idealogically_desc:0  "In nearby countries, considerable groups of loyal faithful are being oppressed by the current controller of those lands. We will set up a program to militarily intervene on behalf of whoever we would prefer to rule those lands."
 TIB_liberate_bhuddist_people_desc:0  "We have had well enough of all these petty kings, generals and politicians around. We will allow them all to share underneath our banner and righeous guidance."
 TIB_fund_monastaries_desc:0  "Due to the remoteness of some of our monastaries some have fallen into disrepair. We will assure they are adequately funded and repaired to allow more and more people to follow us into enlightenment."
 TIB_chinese_border_raids_desc:0  "The forces of the Chinese probe our borders, trying to regain our loyalty. Never again will we bend the knee. We will strike out and do the same to them, their provinces will be ours. Liberating the Tibetan diaspora under us again."
 TIB_british_weapons_desc:0  "We have before gained British weapons to aid in the modernisation of our army, we will request them again. This will keep us a strong and useful buffer state between thei holdings and both the Chinese and the Soviets."
 TIB_foreign_research_desc:0  "Foreign researchers will bee able to aid us in the modernisation of our nation. Of course to what extent we will open up to them is up to us. Will we gain even more strangers in our mountains, or shall we reinforce our propaganda efforts?"
 TIB_large_tibetan_army_desc:0  "For our ambitions we will require a larger Tibetan army to be able to overcome our foes. We will expand our conscription to cover younger men, older men, maybe some women here and there. These conscripts will be trained and pressed into divisions to defend Tibet and the Tibetan people."
 TIB_outside_influences_desc:0  "Countries all around us are experimenting, democracy, communism, other things. Our people have become enamoured with the idea of a modern government. While we would never give an inch to the rabble, it is surely a thought to see what's out there and take the best parts."
 TIB_young_leader_tutor_desc:0  "The young leader's gotten some new tutors recently, a couple white men from a country far away called Germania? Maybe? Well they do know how the world works better than some of the old men around here. Maybe we should hear them out? Besides they are great men, and good climbers. How bad can they be?"
 TIB_lessons_of_the_empires_desc:0  "Many of the empires in the world have been felled by numerous attacks from inside their borders. We will address our own troubles by stomping down hard on the communist vermin trickling in from the Chinese stand-off across from our borders. We will also invest in our border police to shore up our defences against these agitators."
 TIB_populist_maneuvering_desc:0  "It's wonderful what a bit of 'us against them' will do. We have united the Tibetan people behind us by convincing them of a threat both weak enough to overcome and strong enough to be a threat, all around us. Within our country and without."
 TIB_align_nobility_desc:0  "Our nobility will have to stand with us, either thanks to bribes or thanks to threats. We will also cut through the endless miles of red tape by getting rid of the corrupt officials that lag our system down."
 TIB_mobilize_paramilitaries_for_offence_desc:0  "While we have a bit of an army, a lot of our forces are militias in the villages. We will try to mobilize them for the armed forces by recruiting them, nothing a bit of propaganda and some manufactured threats can't do. We will make up some attack on one of our institutions and they will flock to our banner."
 TIB_intervene_north_desc:0  "To the north lays the territory of some Chinese communist warlord who seems loyal to nobody. We will need to intervene before he becomes a threat to us and our way of life. With the people firmly behind us we will march in and take the fight to them. We will be home in mere weeks, the whole thing will come down just by our boots crossing the border."
 TIB_puppet_dalai_lama_desc:0  "The young dalai lama has been listening to us faithfully, while we currently need him to legitimize our orders, that will not be the case for long. If we would like to we could make sure he stays blindly loyal to us, no matter what."
 TIB_fascist_support_desc:0  "Fascism is the new movement and like any movement we grow stronger together. There are more of us across the world, we will send out word and plead for support from them. While Germany might be far away, a well whispered bit of the german tongue in the right ear will get us places. Even Japan could be swayed."
 TIB_weaken_the_jewel_of_the_crown_desc:0  "The jewel of the British crown? Drivel. India is a ethnic hotpot of different identities and backgrounds. By offering even the slightest lies and concessions we will be able to stir up a shitstorm in their lands, making it much easier for us to later calm these people when they arrive in our administration."
 TIB_strengthen_the_professional_army_desc:0  "Strengthening the professional army is vital for any kind of funcitoning state in these wild lands. Here? The law is force, at least for now. So we must be able to project said force through the means of our armed forces. We will make sure they are properly motivated to follow their orders."
 TIB_army_expeditions_desc:0  "Army expeditions will be set up for our forces to go experience life in a modern foreign nation for a while. This will be an ample opportunity to learn some things that we could use to improve our doctrines, maybe make somebody owe us a favor."
 TIB_nothing_is_free_desc:0  "Nothing is free in this world, and our forces do need to be paid. But when dealing with foreign governments it's easy to get rewarded for hard work. We will request our 'ally' to grant us some concessions. We won't be able to stretch them forever, but it'll help for a while."
 TIB_exploit_conquest_for_economy_desc:0  "We have conquered land, altough it's unruly habitans might not accept us as of yet as their rightful overlords it is ours to do with as we please. If we decide to move industry into an area where it stops getting bombed by rebels, then we will do so. No protests or complains will make a dent in our internal policies."
 TIB_an_army_with_an_economy_desc:0  "To make a mighty empire we need to expand our citizen's living space. Expansion requires soldiers, soldiers require arms. We will gear our economy and production to the benefit of the armed forces of our great nation. A strong army will help us prevail."
 TIB_the_military_coup_desc:0  "Due to our reforms and the military's recent success, a faction within the military that is striving for a more authoritarian, nationalistic and militant leadership. They have been empowered, wether intentionally or not, to grab it for themselves. This plan will execute with minimal casualties. Some people might not need to be purged, the dalai lama kid can stay, if he behaves."
 TIB_restructure_the_army_desc:0  "Now that we have a stranglehold over the political and economical power within the country, we can begin gearing everything towards becoming a stronger nation with a suited army. We will make sure our historical claims will be conquered by the mighty men of the Tibetan army!"
 TIB_mountainous_blitzkrieg_desc:0  "The mountaineer from Germany has told us of steel behemoths called 'tanks', which when supported properly could smash through any ranks. We have also heard of these being used by the Japanese and have become enamoured with them. We will train our army to use these modern tools of war."
 TIB_fuel_storage_desc:0  "To keep tanks going we need to be able to store great caches of fuel within our borders. We will set up the additional infrastructure required to get these projects done. The difference between a effective tank force and an ineffective one is only a couple more months of fuel!"
 TIB_further_training_improvements_desc:0 "We have been training our forces already but if we were to train all our troops to the standards of special forces around the world we could even stare down the British Empire's forces in a pinch. Ideal for our land grabs in India or in French Indochina."
 TIB_workers_for_industry_desc:0  "While we are pushing proud Tibetan men into service in our nations, some will need to work the factories and farms. The Hui, Tibeto-Burmans, Ningxia and Liaoning Hui peoples will be given these jobs. Everyone can work a wrench or plow, while only our strong men can defeat the Chinese hordes and arrogant Ghorka's."
 TIB_heerify_army_desc:0   "Our new government is prioritising being able to get our hands on western advisors to train our forces up to their standard. The army will no longer be mere militias but a trained force to swing the tides of battle in our favour."
 TIB_reclaim_the_empire_desc:0  "The Tibetan Empire was once a great empire centered on the Tibetan Plateau, not just restricted to it. Formed as a result of expansion under the Yarlung dynasty under Songtsen Gampo, we will see it's rebirth by invading China for our desired south eastern territories."
 TIB_cross_the_mountains_desc:0  "The Tibetan Empire spread south to reach the Indian ocean by Bengal. We will once again reconquer these lands and let our people eat all the fresh fish they desire. Nepal and Bhutan too will fall before us like cards against the breath of the Tibetan white tiger."
 TIB_south_east_asian_expansion_desc:0  "While the Tibetan Empire was our goal, we are not beyond further expansion. This time not Tibetan swords and armor but Tibetan firearms and explosives will lay waste upon their lands."
 TIB_western_ideas_desc:0  "The Dalai Lama's German advisors have been telling him about universities, scientists, professors and more. Finding this a novel idea, the young ruler has coaxed the regent into funding these programs, which has attracted another German to come over and help."
 TIB_whispers_among_the_downtrodden_desc:0  "The 'Ragyabpa', unclean have been whispering among themselves about liberation and 'heresy'. 'Deponb', descendents of ancient royal families should not be holding so much power, lording over us all. Especially with so many other peoples finding fleeing war and oppression to find more of it here there has been a true evolution in class conciousness..."
 TIB_invite_intellectuals_desc:0  "Inviting intellectuals to our nation to help modernise it, is an intriguing challenge to a lot of them. Sure, it isn't their most cushy option but we'll pay them well enough for their efforts. This will also open up more opportunities for advancing our production, construction or weapons."
 TIB_secure_border_desc:0  "We need to make sure the Tibetan people beyond our northern borders are secure. We will march in and intervene in their little uprising, making sure the government we prefer stays in power."
 TIB_request_support_desc:0  "The workers in our country can't defeat millennia of oppression by Chinese appointed nobility by themselves, they are weak, starving, and underequipped. We will reach out to likeminded governments in the region to see if they could lend us a hand."
 TIB_arm_chinese_communists_desc:0  "There is a nearby communist power laying in wait to become a superpower. As we are veering closer to communist leadership, we should use the refugees from these lands and arm them to fight in our struggle against the imperialists."
 TIB_merge_with_the_chinese_desc:0  "Phuntsok Wangyal has been convincing the members of our party to become one with the Communist Chinese, to become something greater, something more. There's many people's in China and we will be the government for them all, after we have gotten rid of the imperialists, nobles and western colonizers."
 TIB_spring_the_revolt_desc:0  "We are set up to start our fight against the oppressors. Most of us have gathered in the capital and we have become considerably stronger in our preparation, we will fan out after taking Lhasa and subdue the nobles camped out in the rural areas."
 TIB_the_fight_against_imperialism_desc:0  "Communist China has been fighting tooth and nail for it's existence, a widespread war has broken out now. It has to fight again, but it will not stand alone. We will join it to overcome this evil threat, once and for all."
 TIB_the_right_fight_desc:0  "We are doing the right thing and fighting the right fight. We will however, have to get from the west to the front in the east. Access to our troops will have to be given from our military allies."
 TIB_rail_to_capital_tt:0 "A railway will be built to your ally's capital from your own."
 TIB_cultural_revolution_desc:0  "It is vital for a nation after a violent transformation to not just win the people's hearts but to transform their minds as well. We will launch a sociopolitical movement that will transform the Tibetan people and politics by purging remnant of tehocratic and traditional elements from Tibetan society as much as we can."
 TIB_monastaries_into_prisons_desc:0  "We will turn monastaries into prisons, to reform offenders that haven't quite earned the bullet. Monks will become good and red workers, landowners will learn to plow what used to be their lands and former police officers will be forced to study our new laws. The bureaucractic system will be completely renewed and modernized too."
 TIB_radical_immigrants_desc:0 "With the liberation completed, many radical thinkers have flocked to our banner, even some considered to be too radical for most nations. We will shelter them and see if there's a thing or two we can learn from them."
 TIB_state_sponsored_meals_desc:0  "With our agriculture fully reformed, state sponsored meals will assist the workers that need it most. This system will be shared among all of our allied communist brethren, either with our food supplies or their own. This will help our workers perform even in the most dire of times."
 TIB_prisoner_conscription_desc:0  "These revalidated and now loyal communists are just sitting around, doing whatever menial task we throw at them. It is time to throw them at a martial task again, they will be pressed into service of the Tibetan military to fight our enemies for us. If they were to die they will recieve the same honour as any regular other soldier."
 TIB_asian_workers_union_desc:0  "We have been planning and working towards this for a while, we will create a better state, and greater worker's state. No longer restrained by national borders, ethnic lines, or geography. A worker's state for all Asians, liberated under our guise! Workers all over will welcome us with open arms."
 TIB_regional_cooperation_desc:0  "There's governments all around us that, while having differences with us in exact doctrine, are aligned in our wish for a world for workers. We will reach out to work with those that have supported us in our uprising and even those that have not."
 TIB_asian_communist_alignment_desc:0  "We will reach out another hand to the friendly governments in Asia to form a militiary pact. This will further align us together to fight for our goals."
 TIB_establish_red_snow_brigades_desc:0  "We will establish youth groups that will become the forefront of the revolution as it spreads from Tibet further into Asia. These motivated young men and women will be ready to strike down the traditional systems and drag the countries into the modern times, kicking and screaming if they must."
 TIB_infiltrate_red_snow_brigades_desc:0  "By infiltrating Red Guard Brigades into nearby countries, we will be able to get them in key positions to influence the nation they have become embedded in into our sphere. It might take a few months but we will allow the communist movements to grow inside their borders like the pressure on a rock before it cracks."
 TIB_secure_the_wakhan_corridor_desc:0  "Across the wakhan corridor lays Afghanistan, a possible ally as we take down the misguided Stalinists in the north. This Xingjiang buffer zone needs to go first, however. Then we can move on from there."
 TIB_liberate_central_asia_desc:0  "The Soviet Union has been oppressing Asian people for a long time, regardless of what it calls itself. We will have to march in and rescue the central asian people from it's Stalinist woes at the end of a bayonet."
 TIB_himalayan_peoples_union_desc:0  "The himalayan peoples are alike in many ways, it is vital for the viability of our nation to integrate it tightly into our worker's union. We will invest in the defence and industry of these new parts of us."
 TIB_cast_down_our_neighbours_desc:0  "We have threats all around us, at least we can't miss if we fire our weapons wildly in any direction. And that is what we will do. We will invade our neighbours for the sake of the oppressed workers everywehre."
 TIB_legalize_the_tra_desc:0  "We will legalize the existence of the Tibet Revoltion Party, or 'West Tibet Reform Association' as we call it in Tibetan instead of Chinese. A revolutionary, anti-feudal and more pro-republic of China party, it has been banned for a while. It is still a nationalist party which isn't actively seeking for us to be annexed by China, so they can't do too much harm."
 TIB_forward_guard_operations_desc:0  "While we can't be seen actively invading into a nation at civil war, we can definitely send some of our border police slightly further inward to assist the anti-communists."
 TIB_influence_dalai_lama_d_desc:0  "With the Dalai Lama being as young as he is, we will steer him towards caring about the political opinions of his people as well as their physical, mental and spiritual safety. This will make him extremely popular with the people too."
 TIB_divide_spheres_with_raj_desc:0  "The Raj has a near complete hold over the political choices of the other himalayan countries. We will reach out to them and promise to be great friends to them and their imperial overlords as a trade for some minor concessions; the transfering of these countries to Tibetan control."
 TIB_align_territory_desc:0  "With the himalyan territory fully under our control, we will align these states with ourselves. Railways will allow us to reach the place, and we will also have to invest in their industry as well. If they have any autonomy left and we have become a democratic government we will make sure theirs gets one as well."
 TIB_agitate_for_republicanism_desc:0  "A theocracy is best left to the catholics, we will agitate the government with a clear wish; secular political guidance. None of this populist friction between different religious groups, we are all Tibetan."
 TIB_constitutional_theocracy_desc:0  "We believe it's best to still guide the wellbeing of our people by keeping ourselves a spiritual nation, but we will allow the people to elect a political leader to guide us all."
 TIB_our_moment_to_strike_desc:0  "With China occupied, there's never been a better moment to attack the Chinese republic and their warlord cronies, reunite the lands of greater Tibet."
 TIB_monastaries_for_the_people_desc:0  "Our land is dotted with countless autonomous monastaries, we will open them up to allow people to seek learning and refuge in them. The monks can find meaning and zen within meaningful assistance to the community instead of only secluding themselves in silence. Altough if they can do their new job as mentors, teachers and docters in silence? We'll let them."
 TIB_modernisation_drive_desc:0  "Our country is in dire need of a load of modernisation, the bureaucractic system needs to be shaken up and reworked. Proper filing too. Our entire idea of what classes are too. Everybody who deserves anything good will be able to get it."
 TIB_the_fight_against_fascism_desc:0  "The fight against fascism is a righteous one, sure the Republic of China might have some irredentist tendencies, but at least it isn't Japan's pan-asian make-believe. We will fight tooth and nail to keep those imperialists on their island and far away from the himalayas or the shores of the Chinese sea."
 TIB_reaching_the_front_desc:0  "We are doing the right thing and fighting the enemy that will threaten our existence. We will however, have to get from the west to the front in the far east. We will need our allies to give our troops access and train rails will need to be constructed."
 TIB_republic_tibet_desc:0  "We have finally gotten enough support to proclaim the republic of Tibet. A parliament chosen by the people has been assembled to voice their concerns and keep us on our toes about the priorities of it's citizens."
 TIB_further_alignment_desc:0  "The political party of our current president has always been aligned with the Republic of China. It is time for us to reach out and tie our two countries together in a pact of cooperation and alignment, both economically and politically."
 TIB_business_with_warlords_desc:0  "The warlords in China are pretty much autonomous provinces, we will reach out to them to see what they can mean to us. We will have to make haste, while they still exist and get to make their own decisions."
 TIB_you_get_dockyards_tt:0 "You will get three dockyards in the coastal state."
 TIB_responsible_expansionism_desc:0  "Some people are in fact unhappy with their current administration and would be very happy to join us instead. We will reach out to these people and their government to see if we can broker some sort of referendum in those states. We will of course assure their safety and happiness."
 TIB_cast_down_the_thunder_dragon_desc:0  "The Kingdom of the Thunder Dragon, an antiquated state just past our borders. We desperately need to cleanse this backward stain of a place of it's traditions and bring it into the modern age."
 TIB_liberate_arunachal_pradesh_desc:0  "Arunachal Pradesh is a hotly contested area between the Indians and the Chinese, we border it as well. We will seize it from the Indians alongside any places of our interest."
 TIB_liberate_himalayan_people_desc:0  "We will need to liberate the himalayan people from the yoke of being what boils dotn to just another British puppet. While not officially one of their dominions or colonies, we will need to act quick if we want to make sure they stay far away from becoming a jewel in the English crown."
 TIB_collaborate_with_british_desc:0  "If we choose to collaborate with British Empire we could give them a hand in exchange for some prime real estate in the form of some of their Asian land. Burma for example looks rather nice this time of year and we will of course help them in their second great war."
 TIB_regional_pressure_desc:0  "We will exert pressure on regions nearby to make their government submit to a referendum. Of course we can always march in to enforce the will of the free people if they were to choose not to ratify a legal and official referendum."
 TIB_tibetan_law_desc:0  "With a Tibet government by the people's choice, the law will have to reflect the morals and wishes of said people. We will pen a great lawbook, representing all peoples within our borders."
 TIB_request_compensation_desc:0  "We can't possibly have fought in this war, lost thousands of men, for nothing. We will not be told goodbye with nothing much of a reward except some looted rifles and a few bucks. We will send for the governments controlling Greater Tibetan land and request compensation for our participation in this fight."
 TIB_a_safe_northern_border_desc:0  "A part of Greater Tibet is the area to our north, and while we might not initially have joined for that sake, we very much would like those lands to rejoin us. We will request them as a payment for services rendered. Our people will be liberated, finally. Through diplomacy even, unless they decline..."
 TIB_stem_refugee_flow_desc:0  "Stemming this constant inflow of Kazakhs, Turkic and Hui people's will be needed to stabilize our country, get it functioning again. There's only so much food to go around and we are in no shape to take care of all these others for now."
 TIB_internal_matters_desc:0  "Something is rotten inside the bureaucractic machine of Tibet, some are dying just because their requests and communications don't come through on time. We will really need to improve this situation if we are to have any semblance of a functioning country at all. Mobilize troops for example? How? We don't know where they even live! We could find out but it'd take us decades like this.."
 TIB_welcome_refugee_flow_desc:0  "It would be unethical and idiotic to refuse refugees from entering our country. These people are a great opportunity, as workers, soldiers but also as a reason to wage war against those that wronged them."
 TIB_no_stab_hit_if_crops_or_herds_tt:0 "You will not suffer this stability loss if you have completed the focus §Y'Subsidize our Crops'§! or §Y'Support Animal Herds'§!."
 TIB_religious_equality_desc:0  "There are some among us that don't follow bhuddist beliefs. Equality for them in the eyes of the law is the right thing to do and will also help us in gaining  with these people in conquered lands nearby."
 TIB_bhuddist_supremacy_desc:0  "Tibet is first and foremost a bhuddist country and ensuring that our religion will keep it's prominent position in our country will keep us strong and aligned with our history. It will also help us with the population of north eastern indian states..."
 TIB_a_feudal_industry_desc:0  "Tibet's industry is lagging far behind due to the entire system being pretty much just a feudal one. It will require a lot of work for it to become functional again. Of course the first step for that is to be getting some more factories up and running."
 TIB_arm_tibet_desc:0  "Tibet will require weapons to fight her battles, to arm her we will need to construct some military factories. It will pump out bullets, weapons that can house and shoot said bullets, maybe even a cannon or two."
 TIB_modern_state_academy_desc:0  "To catapult us into the future, we will need academics and highly educated people. For this purpose we will need schools, so that is what we will build. In these academies young Tibetans can become more than they have been before."
 TIB_oil_fuel_desc:0  "We will need fuel, not just to power our trains but also to power lights after we have electrified the country. Oil is as good as a source for fuel as any. We will drill deep and far to find a source no matter where."
 TIB_refine_coal_desc:0  "We have discovered that by refining coal, you can also create a sort of fuel, with all sorts of interesting byproducts. This will be good for the possible creation of trucks or even planes! We will set up some of these facilities around our mountains, maybe some idiotic enemies will think we are surrounded by volcanoes due to the smoke."
 TIB_resource_effort_desc:0  "To do nearly anything up this high we will need to work the mountains, drilling and blasting great holes into it. During one of our latest efforts to create a habitable environment we found some metals. We will need to research better and deeper drills and other extraction techniques to get this zinc, copper and lead above ground."
 TIB_resource_mining_alu_desc:0  "Bauxite mining will be vital for our country. This sedimentary rock has a high aluminium content, this light metal will allow us to create sturdy and lightweight things. This could bring us closer to airships, or even portable tools for our troops!"
 TIB_resource_mining_steel_tungsten_desc:0  "Mining and smelting to create steel and tungsten will allow us to ramp up production of artillery, guns, and even armored cars. We aren't quite sure what they are or how they will get anywhere in the mountains, but they sound quite impressive."
 TIB_putting_it_to_use_desc:0  "We have obtained the resources, it is now time to feed them to the great jaws of industry. Of course we will invest further into our industry to assure we aren't just going to sit here with a resource surplus that goes unused."
 TIB_dams_for_power_desc:0  "Hydroelectrics might be the best solution for us. Population has gathered around water sources anyways, so dams could generate power for these population centers. This way the electricity gets straight to the people that need it."
 TIB_production_modernisation_desc:0  "The modernisation of production could be the key to make sure our amy is equipped, our people are fed and spare parts are available where needed. For this we need factories, yes. But also a better way of working, a smarter way of working. Luckily we have developed it, with a little inspiration from abroad."
 TIB_production_scaling_desc:0  "Now that we have our production ready and set up, now we have to scale it all up. 'More' is a quality all of it's own. We need to do this is we want to not just have weapons and a bit of ammunition, but enough supplies to achieve all of our goals."
 TIB_modern_construction_desc:0  "Modern construction has alluded us for a long time, but with all these new techniques like cement mixing, we can finally achieve it now. With new building techniques, we can make bigger buildings, quicker. Sure they might not be as pretty but decoration can always be added later. "
 TIB_villages_to_cities_desc:0  "Turning mere villages into real city centers requires not just a lot of urban planning but also population controls. We will move some nearby villages into the new cities, allowing more remote villages in the rural areas to stay the way they are. Somebody has to feed the cities."
 TIB_electrify_country_desc:0  "Electrifying the country will be a great undertaking but it will bring many great comforts to the citizens of Tibet. Besides, factories and government facilities will be able to use it too. Phones, fridges, reliable light, the future is now!"
 TIB_reaching_places_desc:0  "Reaching locations in Tibet can be hard, it takes a long time and you have to really plan and bring enough supplies. But if we were to construct great railway projects, we can move people and cargo great lengths, without as much of a fuss. This will benefit everyone, greatly."
 TIB_tibetan_plateau_agriculture_desc:0  "Farming on the Tibetan plateau can be hard, due to limited arable land, livestock raising is the primary occupation on the Tibetan plateau. We will have to work hard to make sure farming becomes not just sustainable but a good job for all."
 TIB_opium_trade_desc:0  "The opium trade could bring us great benefit, since the initial opium wars many in Asia have become addicted to smoking opium. We can use that to pad our income to great extent."
 TIB_soldier_poppies_desc:0  "Opiates can be used for the suppression of pain, farming poppies can benefit our army if we were to produce painkillers with them. Of course they will be regulated and restricted, but it will allow our soldiers to fight harder and longer."
 TIB_centralize_farming_desc:0  "We will centralize farming, letting our administration decide what grows, where and when. This will allow us to scale our crop production and to allow co-ops to help each other get out of bad harvests and other failures."
 TIB_citizen_farmlands_desc:0  "We will allow our citizens to till the farmlands they were already working. Of course we'll redistribute some of the land a bit. Not just to show that we're the boss, but also to make sure only those loyal to the government obtain any semblance of power."
 TIB_subsidize_on_crops_desc:0  "To make sure our locally grown Tibetan crops afforadable for the people we will need to subsidize our crops. It will also keep the peasants content and loyal to their rulers. In whatever way that might be."
 TIB_support_animal_herds_desc:0  "We have made sure our farming has become viable, but now it is time to extend a hand towards the people tending to the herds. We can't make butter tea without yak milk, so we will make sure all of the animals get taken care of until their last breath. The people too, in whichever order."
 TIB_state_carpet_factory_desc:0  "Tibetan rug making is an ancient, traditional craft. Tibetan rugs are traditionally made from Tibetan highland sheep's wool, called changpel. While a state funded carpet factory might not be able to replace these traditional rugs, but it will make isolating the home more affordable for the poorer segments of the country."
 TIB_civ_economy_desc:0  "There's no point in improving our civilian economy to then just export everything. We will lower the amount of exports so we can keep enough of it for ourselves and our people. Export can be nice but we only have so many miles to invest the income in."
 TIB_factory_serfs_desc:0  "Well if we are going to have a large workforce of people at our leisure, we can put them to work for other state related benefits, like the army. These factories will be small villages in and of themselves, living quarters, mess halls and everything."
 TIB_cheap_labor_desc:0  "They used to be serfs, slaves almost. So we now have our hands on a workforce that doesn't quite know how to value itself yet. Cheap labour like this is paramount for building up our country, they'll get better wages once we have the industry running, of course."
 TIB_reform_the_system_desc:0  "Reforming the current labour system is vital for restoring the faith of the lowest classes in our leadership. It's the right thing to do. If this helps our government become more popular and have men flock to our banner to join the army? A nice side benefit."
 TIB_reduce_inequality_desc:0  "Reducing inequalities between what the classes used to be like, women and men, Tibetan or otherwise, will be what equalizes us all."
 TIB_land_reform_desc:0  "We desperately need land reform to change how the land ownership, use and transfer works in Tibet. Not according to noble families, or powerful connections. But according to what's right, what's smart and what's right."
 TIB_finish_the_reformation_desc:0  "Finishing up the reform scheme that we have been working on will be rewarding. The popularity of the ruling party has skyrocketed as well, and the people are happy and stable. Proud of their land and their people, they will fight for their right to keep it like this"
 TIB_you_will_unlock_industrial_concern_tt:0 "You will unlock the following industrial concern:"
 TIB_serfs_by_other_names_desc:0  "Serfdom gets a bad reputation, we will overhaul our indentured peasantry system to be more efficient. We'll call it something else as well, migration controlled laborers maybe? While more labor might mean less men for the army, we will put them right to work and it'll pay off in the longer term.."
 TIB_empower_specific_groups_desc:0  "A hierarchical system with leaders and folowers needs the strong and the mighty and the less fortunate. We have plenty of less fortunate within our borders, but we will need to empower the ones that will hold power. When we give them more power, they will become more loyal to our government, and keep the weaker ones in line."
 TIB_control_the_middle_division_desc:0  "The 'treba', taxpayers and 'dujung', householders are what we call the middle division. The middle division is who we need both loyal and oppressed. By allocating blame for their suffering on people outside our borders we will make them angry and ready to fight or work. This still keeps them weak enough that they won't rebel and they will fight only when we give them the tools and target to fight."
 TIB_keep_the_lower_division_placated_desc:0  "The lowest division is made up by 'ragyabpa', unclean workers, hereditary household servants and other serfs. We will keep them silent and ready to work. They can be a great asset to this country if managed and allocated properly."
 TIB_start_overhauling_army_desc:0  "The Tibetan army has a long way to go from the rabble with British rifles it currently is. While we will make sure to improve morale and pay, we also will set up a foreign training regiment where they go and fight real battles in real wars. There is no substitute for boots on the ground experience."
 TIB_issue_promotions_desc:0  "With our troops more motivated than ever and getting some real training in, it is important to issue promotions to ambitious and promising men that could be applying themselves well in higher positions."
 TIB_supply_improvements_desc:0  "It's hard to keep our troops supplied, not just because it is not easy getting around in the himalayas but also because it's sometiomes hard to source the uniforms, food and ammunition required by infantry. We will overhaul our supply system to allow for better provisions and aid i nthe time that our men need it most."
 TIB_engineer_corps_desc:0  "Setting up a modern engineer corps to practice the art, science and well, practice of designing and building military works can be paramount in fighting in these regions. Temporary roads, bridges and more can be installed to provide a great advantage over whatever enemy we face."
 TIB_fortification_focus_desc:0  "Fortifications are one of the eldest forms of military engineering, both this and siege warfare. For now we will focus on setting up great forts to protect our borders from any who dare probe them and harass our population."
 TIB_forward_engineering_operations_desc:0  "Sure, some engineering can be done by troops that are not in combat operations, but a select few will be elite as elite engineer divisions that will fight as tough as they construct. They will rain bullets and explosives on the enemy where once there was only rain, and when their corpses have been flooded away by physics of man or nature, we will reign victorious."
 TIB_a_cannon_to_shake_the_heavens_desc:0  "A cannon to shake the heavens, has been promised by our engineers. They will require a grand researching fortification, a lot of time and men, but they swear it can be done. An artillery piece so grand that it will require rails and trains to run them. Of course, this will all be for nothing if we don't have any or enough traintrack for it to run on."
 TIB_modernize_cannons_desc:0  "Some of our cannons are truly ancient, they will need to go through the process of modernisation. Bigger, more accurate and able to hit across miles of land. That is the goal."
 TIB_mountain_cannons_desc:0  "With the right spotters and communications, modern cannons can strike not just from mountains, but over them. From our capital straight into the hearts of the enemy our shells will rain."
 TIB_himalayan_mountaineers_desc:0  "Himalayan mountaineers have never been a common or even a mere rare sight. Reserved for the miniature armies of our southern neighbours, we will need to train our men extensively to not just be equal to theirs, but better."
 TIB_regular_patrols_desc:0  ""In a region as remote and inaccessible as the Tibetan Plateau, regular patrols are paramount. However, due to the limited training our personnel have received so far, patrols have been confined to villages and cities. We will train our men for as long as we need to allow them to patrol the mountaintops."
 TIB_mountain_cold_desc:0  "The mountain cold is a true killer. Long have we told stories and myths as warnings to keep our kids inside and our men back inside on time. But the cold is also an opportunity. To train our mountaineers extensively, to withstand and embrace the cold. An invading army unprepared for winter? Will surely fall and fail."
 TIB_finished_mountaineer_training_desc:0  "We have fininished developing the mountaineer training of our troops. They will be able to strike from banks of snows and frozen glaciers, climbing mountains high and swimming rivers low to strike deep into enemy territories. They will be terrifyingly effective, and ready to do exactly what we want them to do."
 TIB_professionalize_soldiers_desc:0  "We have had to rely for way too long on militias and need to professionalize our soldiers. We will disband the militas and create real fighting men from our recruits instead. No longer confined to the villages they grew up, they will fight where and when we want."
 TIB_former_militia_equipment_desc:0  "The former militia might not have had troves of equipment but they were also equipped by local nobles and sometimes even foreign governments. We will take great effort to safely and fully disarm all of them, the regional, local and national militias."
 TIB_professional_officers_desc:0  "Professional officers will be formed through training existing talent extensively in a school we will set up for them. They will learn foreign techniques and battle plans to complement the things they already know. We will make sure they follow our overal doctrine exactly as it is written."
 TIB_training_and_recruitment_desc:0  "Training and recruitment has always been a topic for the military forces in Tibet. We will have to press men into service to keep our conscription up and working enough to supply the units on the front with fresh unbloodied bodies. It might not be very popular, but we desperately need more men to fight the near unsurmountable armies of our neighbours."
 TIB_state_arm_factories_desc:0  "An army is only as strong as it's weakest rifles, state governed arms factories will supply our troops directly. While expensive to set up, this will allow us to cut through a lot of the supply issues that come from getting the rifles to an armory or supply depot."
 TIB_the_tibetan_soldier_desc:0  "The Tibetan soldier is a proud and strong one, ready to fight at a moment's notice, all throughout his motherland. Through training and experience these men are tough and spoiling for a fight. Rgyal kha nye bar slebs yod!"
 TIB_a_pain_to_invade_desc:0  "A country this high up? Mountainous? Invading it would be extremely costly, for anyone. Even a major nation wouldn't be as stupid as invade us, especially from multiple oceans away. The British might have to think twice if they decide that we would be a nice northern raj."
 TIB_rely_on_village_militias_desc:0  "Relying on village militias has always worked for us, it's a reliable source of manpower and they usually come with their own small arms. Sure they're usually muskets so they are due replacement, but the loyalty to their village and their willingness to fight usually pays off."
 TIB_centralize_local_armament_production_desc:0  "Village militias have usually sourced their own arms from local workshops and craftsmen, or bribing border guards on both sides of the border. Centralising this system to be coherent and properly paid for would get us a steady supply of arms without risking any diplomatic incidents."
 TIB_local_command_autonomy_desc:0  "Local commanders have always led the militias they raised and often grew up with. They references and experience in thee area will make them deadly foes if we allow them the autonomy to execute their orders as they please. Their inside jokes and crude comments might be distracting sometimes but the men are fiercely loyal to them. And we can't put a price on that."
 TIB_irregular_groups_desc:0  "Irregulars are just another term for militias, private armies, mercenaries. These kinds of skirmishers are rife in Tibet and pressing them into official paid government service might be for the best. We're sure we can find some more of these in local states."
 TIB_steady_supply_ammo_desc:0  "A steady supply of ammunition is vital to keep our troops firing in the right directions. Especially with our reliance on these ragtag forces it can be hard to supply them due to them all being armed with a very varied group of arms. We will set up factories to produce a range of ammunitions, even for weapons we don't produce ourselves. Nobody ask private Chöphel where he got that machine gun..."
 TIB_a_prepared_state_militia_desc:0  "A prepared state militia is better than no forces at all. While we certainly have a lot of different branches of infantry. It'll be extremely hard for some huge country to invade us if every citizen might have a gun here or there. These armed citizens will fight tooth and nail to defend their home."
 TIB_increase_conscription_desc:0  "We will need to aggressively up our conscription, now that we can finally figure out where people live. The bureaucracy was a pain to navigate around, but now we will have the means to find young and able bodied men to push a rifle onto."
 TIB_the_air_corps_desc:0  "Mountains high, armed forces higher. That seems like a dream, but it could be a reality. We will send out our men to train in foreign lands, fly foreign planes. This practice will come in handy when we have planes for them to occupy."
 TIB_guard_to_the_sky_desc:0  "Guarding our people from foreign airforces is vital, our people need to live unbothered by enemy bombs. The sy will become grey with lead the second someone dares to invade the peace of the himalayan peaks."
 TIB_state_transport_planes_desc:0  "It's the responsibility of the state to be able to supply our people everywhere. Some villages are so remote that transport planes might be the only option to resolve their plights. A state sponsored program will be set up to address these issues."
 TIB_mountainous_paratroopers_desc:0  "Special forces that can redeploy quickly throughout the mountains might be the key in putting the fight to the enemy. Training these men will be a long and hard process but it could help us greatly. Like eagles from the sky they will fall upon the enemy worms, their lives snatched up in moments."
 TIB_expand_the_aircraft_infrastructure_desc:0  "The aircraft infrastructure will have to be expanded from virtually nothing to a thriving manufacturing center for planes that can roll right up on the airbase. Of course we can just retool the factory to start pumping out hunting rifles when these troubling times are over."
 TIB_modernize_aircraft_facilities_desc:0  "Centralizing all airbases in one place is a good way to get them bombed out and rendered inoperable. We will place them down in every state where the local populace isn't going to immediately bomb the things themselves. A couple cannons next to them will keep them safe from threat above."
 TIB_import_foreign_planes_desc:0  "Importing foreign planes is the easiest way to get proper flying vehicles in our people's hands. Maybe it won't be fast or cheap, but it will be easy. We will have to rely on the market of course, but we aren't afraid to spend into the right hands and stuff the right pockets."
 TIB_licensed_production_desc:0  "Licensed production could be the key to get solid plane designs ready to be made in our factories. They will be real Tibetan planes anyways, just without the expensive, extensive and slow research and development that goes into homegrown ones."
 TIB_increase_domestic_aircraft_development_desc:0  "Our factories soiled by planes that aren't researched by Tibetan men and women? We would rather fly rocks through the sky. Domestic aircraft development is the answer to the aircraft question. We've got scientists eager as anything to start learning about aerodynamics, whatever that is."
 TIB_fund_flying_schools_desc:0  "Funding flying schools will allow us to get rid of any ill beliefs and superstition that they might have picked up in their training in other countries. Training will be improved as well, to create better pilots."
 TIB_intensify_pilot_training_program_desc:0  "Intensifying our pilot training program will allow us to form a truly professional and ready airforce that will be ready to trade wins with even the British or Japanese if need be. Smarter use of fuel will be good for our use of resources. Improving our doctrine will make our air missions efficient."
 TIB_expand_aviation_institutes_desc:0  "Expanding this little training program to become proper institutions of our country won't be easy, but with enough bribes and defectors, we can form a teacher regime of former foreign pilots. Of course, in time we'll replace them with our own. We've also discovered it's light work, so we are now allowing women to replace able bodied fighting men."
 TIB_ground_support_desc:0  "Planes help, but ground battles win wars. Ground support planes are the future of battle, able to bomb the enemy from up close, allowing our troops to move in. No symphony more sweet than that of soldier and airman working together in harmony. We will research whatever we need to make these a reality."
 TIB_long_range_aircraft_desc:0  "Big and heavy airplanes, the size of dragons. Bombing out the enemy's industry, homes and capabilities to feed their troops. It'll be devestating for ourt enemy, but that is none of our concern."
 TIB_experimental_planes_desc:0  "Experimental designs have popped up in our labs, we don't know which of the mad bastards have been making them, but we have decided to fund them in a new facility. Also the Japanese are sending planes into ships? Why don't we strap some explosives to some flying things and have them hit some prime bases."
 TIB_research_modern_navies_desc:0  "Researching modern navies might come in handy when we get settled in a state close enough to a sea. Both ships themselves and doctrines will have to be developed in due time. Maybe even in preparation?"
 TIB_invest_in_dockyards_desc:0  "Well we might not have many coastal states, but we will have to make it count. By investing in the construction of some dockyards we will able to create ships to project some level of naval strength. Mostly to keep enemy troops from landing on our shores, of course."
 TIB_stockpile_fuel_desc:0  "To keep our planes going we need to be able to store caches of fuel within our borders. We will set up the infrastructure required to get these planes in the air. The difference between a effective airforce and an ineffective one is only a couple more months of fuel!"
 TIB_TIB_merchant_ships_desc:0  "Tibetan merchants will have to use whatever they can, ships down to rivers for example. We can use them to trade for resources or other goods. Both the arms market and the steel markets will greatly benefit us all. It will feed the war machine after all."
 TIB_TIB_marines_desc:0  "Tibetan marines? It sounds ridiculous but we will have to build some sort of capability to land troops onto enemy shores. Of course we will have to start by teaching our men to swim. Preferably with their equipment and well enough to save someone else who isn't as well equipped to handle the vengeful waters."
 TIB_invest_in_modern_navy_desc:0  "Investing in a modern navy means building ships, fast. Good ships too, altough everyone's definition might be different. We will train some landless peasants to become expert shipbuilders, no mere unskilled labour for them. Not anymore."
 TIB_undersea_combat_desc:0  "Undersea combat sounds ideal. We will be invisible and indivisable. A way to fight without the enemy being able to fight back? With minimal risk of casualties? Sure our conscripts might not be used to not being able to see large mountains close around them, but steel shells might not be that different."
 TIB_cruiser_submarines_desc:0  "Cruiser submarines could strike far away to the shores of whatever continent the enemy comes from. They will feel all comfortable and will not be patrolling their waters that aggressively."
 TIB_midget_submarines_desc:0  "Smaller submarines that we can cover the entire ocean floor with would be perfect. If any of them got sunk, we will suffer minimal losses, and they are pretty cheap to make. Of course they will have a lessened impact on the battle but hey, a torpedo still blows up if the boat it comes from is small."
 TIB_surface_combat_desc:0  "Even on the surface we will have to fight, fight to keep our waters clear of enemy submarines and fight to keep the convoys coming in. Of course we'd prefer not to run into any battleships, but we won't flee neither. With enough guns, any behemoth will fall."
 TIB_improved_screen_ships_desc:0  "Improving our coastal defense ships will keep our land clear from any shenanigans the enemy might launch at us from the seas. This of course is worth investing in. We have acquired some designs from overseas which has made our captains and admirals giddy with anticipations. It'll take months to pump these babies out, but they will be as happy as the mother of a newborn child."
 TIB_unlocks_decisions_regent_tt:0 "This unlocks decisions to either replace your leader or become a junta. Once this is done you will be able to improve your army spirit through another decision."
 TIB_every_core_state_tt:0 "You will gain the following effect for each core state:"

 SAU_import_german_equipment_desc:0 "While we have some experience with tanks already, we know that the terrain in africa and arabia are some of our biggest concerns. The equipment we need the most is that of aircraft. We shall request some from Germany."
 SAU_bombard_the_sinai_desc:0 "The british empire spans most of the world, we will have to get every benefit we could get. For this reason we will try to get a technological edge if we can get it, to rush the suez canal with. Once that's blown, our german and italian friends can safely get over to us to fight with us against the westerners."
 SAU_arming_the_revolt_desc:0 "While the entire point of the arab revolt in Palestine is to shake off imperialists and we wish not to ally with the new empires in the west, we will use them regardless. We will make sure the Germans trust our Saudi middlemen and go forward with their plans to ship rifles to the rebels."
 SAU_off_the_back_of_a_truck_desc:0 "Now that a large amount of weapons are moving around in and through our country towards the levant, this creates opportunity for local tribes and younger movements. We will obtain some weapons, both German and otherwise, from these shipments. This will allow these rebel groups to arm themselves."
 SAU_soviet_assistance_desc:0 "The Soviets sound very open to helping out the fledgling communist movement in our country. Both minority religions and weaker tribes are very willing to flock to the red banner. This will empower them to start putting plans in place, like getting rid of this king while he's off doing some religious ceremony."
 SAU_organize_mixed_militias_desc:0 "In this new movement it's vital for mixed militias to be created. We need to create social cohesion between these groups and make them realise they are but one group, the worker's class. These worker militias will remove inner-movement friction."
 SAU_underground_workshops_desc:0 "Underground workshops will allow us to further arm and equip our militias and prepare for the uprising. Allowing anyone and everyone to get their hands on a rifle will allow them to feel safe and prepared for the future."
 SAU_an_attempt_at_a_coup_desc:0 "We have prepared, our troops are armed. Our movement is growing stronger by the day. It might be time for us to unleash the red wave of the proletariat onto the entrenched system of tyrannical monarchism of our country. While we aren't sure this will go peacefully, we are prepared to fight for a brighter and more just future."
 SAU_squash_counter_coups_desc:0 "Now that we have shown our people that a violent revolution is possible, and that the status-quo is not invicible.... We have to make sure no counter-coups can be made to succeed. No reinstatement of Faisal Saud, no fascism and no capitalism. We need to secure the people and whip her into a communist frenzy, is your neighbor a scheming fascist? Report him."
 SAU_international_brigades_desc:0 "International brigades are soldiers recruited to fight and assist rightful and aligned governments worldwide in their struggle. For their freedom and for ours, we shall organise arabian units to march across the sands, grass and rock towards liberation of the world wherever it is going on."
 SAU_the_topic_of_religion_and_education_desc:0 "Religion has been deeply entrenched within the Arabian people and our education is deeply entwined with it. Our choice is simple: Do we go the stalinist route and try to de-islamize from above, or do we create a unique blend of islam and communism?"
 SAU_state_media_desc:0 "We have no television station in our lands and our people know not the radio. Democratic state media will be a new concept to them, but is uniquely positioned in our country to become the one source of truth for the masses, who are yet unfamiliar with how media could work to secure their minds."
 SAU_ally_the_kurds_desc:0 "The Kurds are feudal communities with chieftain who enjoy a certain degree of (often hard fought) autonomy within nearby countries. Working towards freeing these people from their chiefs as well as their feudalistic ways and oppressive countries would be an excellent way to spread the revolution in our region."
 SAU_bolster_local_and_regional_movements_desc:0 "There are plenty of local and regional movements for liberation from imperialism and oppression, for autonomy and for a just treatment of the working class. We will reach out to these groups and promise them support for their eventual alignment with the policies we hold dear."
 SAU_toe_the_party_line_desc:0 "Of course the Soviet Union knows the direction our country should take! Our leader is a staunch stalinist and is in direct contact with comrade Stalin. It is for the best to let them guide our policies in the region and internationally. We have only been communist for a little while, they have been around for much longer and have achieved great success!"
 SAU_soviet_industry_desc:0 "Aligning with the USSR of course allows us to gain industrial support from one of the world's mightiest industries. Sharing our resources freely between our countries will allow us both to benefit from a bolstered heavy industry. A great communist state without a great industrial machine is bound to fail, after all."
 SAU_soviet_tank_tech_desc:0 "The Soviets have been working with it's theories to eleborate on the principles of combat use of armored units. We of course are no stranger to using tanks, as we did in Yemen. We will lobby for the secrets of Soviet tank production and divisions to apply this on our lands to fight the good fight."
 SAU_union_democratic_youth_desc:0 "The youth is the future and aligning the democratic youth movement with our governments principles will allow us to become and stay the popular movement. The zealotry that can be found with the young will be a perfect example to the worker's that drive our country."
 SAU_global_liberation_desc:0 "The global liberation from capitalists and fascists is vital to the continuation of the free worker's state. We will secure our place in the world at the tip of a sword and crush our opposition under the threads of our tanks!"
 SAU_the_anti_stalinist_purge_desc:0 "Our current chairman is a stalinist, we will have to replace him. While the USSR was a help to us, we do not intend to commit on suckling on another empire's teat. We used to get support from the british empire, we do not intend to have to rely on another again. The strength of the worker is all we need."
 SAU_female_liberation_desc:0 "Female liberation is at the forefront of equality and progression, while our society has a more conservative background, we will drag our people into the modern times. While they are kicking and screaming if we must. The elevation of the women in our country is the elevation of us all."
 SAU_land_reform_desc:0 "Major land reform is required to place the land into the care of the workers and peasants, not the tribes and tribal leaders of old. We will free up appropriate space with this for industry that will be able to improve efficienctly."
 SAU_collaborate_with_allies_desc:0 "Working together with our idealogical brothers in arms seems to be vital in progressing our cause. Only through our favor and the tightest of collaboration can we lift each other up and prepare properly for the fight to come."
 SAU_cast_down_the_russian_perversion_desc:0 "Casting down the Russian perversion that calls itself the Soviet Union is integral to establishing ourselves as the primary communist leader of the world. This one-party totalitarian police state, rife with collectivization of agriculture and personality cults? It is not what Marx would've wanted, nor Lenin. It is time for this charade to end."
 SAU_secure_security_from_the_med_desc:0 "Securing the suez is how we can control what ports we'd need to defend from imperialist forces. The Egyptian workers should welcome us with open arm, we just need to kick the door to the empire down and it should crumble. We will be able to get out of a further prolonged conflict as well, if we project strength, hold and secure core arab lands."
 SAU_monument_to_our_accomplishments_desc:0 "As a monument to our accomplishments we shall raise a monument to our successes. There is but one true communist state around these parts and it's us. There will be no doubt in anyone's mind about that."
 SAU_negotiating_the_end_desc:0 "Negotiating the end of this revolution won't be easy, but with some diplomatic maneuvering and a major amount of pressure from our state it can be done. Of course this will mean the end of the Zionist project and the merging of these two colonial states into one under us. But the people will be happier than under the British and the only group that wouldn't be can find a different place."
 SAU_strengthen_shura_council_desc:0 "The Majlis ash-Shura or the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia is permitted to propose draft laws and forward them to the king, but only the king has the power to pass  them. However we will broaden tje mandate of Majlis Al-Shura to include proposing new legislation and amending existing laws without prior submission."
 SAU_invite_western_pressure_desc:0 "Inviting more western influence into our institutions allow us to push through some reforms that are less than popular among our Saudi elite. We can just blame the west for it, while siphoning away power from the king and his loyal nobles and clergy."
 SAU_safeguard_levantine_posessions_desc:0 "With the French state under threat, maybe it is best if we were to take hold and protect their levantine posessions. Of course they would be safer under our watchful gaze. No really, no need for further reward. Although...."
 SAU_threaten_for_a_republic_desc:0 "With the momentum we've gained, we can properly threaten the status quo for a true republic. A true secular modern one, like the ones in the west. Of course we would work together with the British to achieve our goals. Our presence in this region will be a calming one."
 SAU_force_secularisation_desc:0 "Forcing secularisation in this country will not be easy, but we will assure them that this is just for regional and national politics. We still have religious voters, of course. However our law and governance is done by the people, not God."
 SAU_promise_non_interference_to_the_british_desc:0 "We will promise non-interference to the British for their affairs in the region. We will not interact with Oman at all for example, in trade that they do the same."
 SAU_convert_the_hashemites_desc:0 "The hashemites that are present in Iraq once attempted to be one of the players in the Arabian lands. Najd, the highlands, were once theirs. Now instead we have conquered those old lands as well as Iraq itself. As they once claimed, we are all one. Let us reinforce this message and unite with these northern arabians."
 SAU_vengeance_for_the_ottoman_yoke_desc:0 "The ottomans once terrorised arabia through their jabal shammar puppets, the great war and the arab revolt put an end to that. Now we will return with a vengeance and cast down these rebranded imperialists. No matter how secular our respective governments are, we will send them to God."
 SAU_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "A constitutional monarchy would be the smallest possible transition into a type of democracy. We could wean more power away from the king over time and become more of a British type of monarchy. For now we will allow our king a modicum of power. We will however have all the right to strip him of any power should we need it."
 SAU_a_careful_balance_desc:0 "A careful balance between a religious people and a rational government is vital. We must let the coolest and most rational heads prevail. While we find our religion quite important, there must be a balance between when to follow the book of law or the Qur'an."
 SAU_two_kingdoms_one_imam_desc:0 "Us and the British must be able to come to an agreement as two kingdoms in regards to the sultanate in Oman. Obviously we aren't at war with them, so we wouldn't have much of an issue with them docking their boats on our shores. We would have no problems with the imamate of Oman and we could get the sultanate to submit to us if needed."
 SAU_reorganize_our_states_desc:0 "We must reorganize our provinces and integreate autonomous regions to fully allow them to represent themselves in our political system. These puppet governments and regional leaders have served their purpose and will now be integrated into our system of regional governance."
 SAU_governing_council_desc:0 "A governing council will be set up to temporarily govern the nation as we transfer into a true democracy. There's a lot to unpack and plan and while we did not quite have the momentum to fully get everything the way we wanted to, we have time."
 SAU_compromise_with_religious_groups_desc:0 "We will have to compromise with religious groups that have considerable power among our people. Of course these people all will have voting power in due time, so getting them placated before then will be paramount. Otherwise they could just vote in some puppet that would restore the monarchy fully. Or worse, turn us into a theocracy...."
 SAU_intervene_in_the_yemeni_coup_desc:0 "Intervening in Yemen to unseat the coup that has happened would just be the neighborly thing to do. The Saudi-Yemeni war isn't long ago and clearly the losing part of the conflict has been having some issues getting the country back together. We will march in, as liberators? Or will we reinstall the previous dynasty? We shall see when we get there."
 SAU_unifying_arabia_desc:0 "Unifying Arabia to the fullest extent we can might be an irredentist ideal, it will surely secure our position as a popular government among our people. Sure the British might not be the biggest fans of losing Oman but they are one of our earliest fans. They will get over it. This is but the first step on our plan to make the arab world for arabs again."
 SAU_the_arab_league_desc:0 "We will set up the Arab League as a regional organisation we will draw relations closer between member states and coordinate collaboration. This will allow us to safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of the Arab countries."
 SAU_intervene_in_the_levant_desc:0 "Securing the levant is vital to disrupt both the zionist project and the disturbances in the region. We will march in and secure these lands from the inept British administrators who have been mucking about with people they do not understand in ways that no arab could let go unpunished."
 SAU_foster_fanaticism_desc:0 "Fostering fanaticism among our people will drive them further and further into extremism. Sure we will have some counter movements pop up, but nothing that a freshly organised militia can't deal with."
 SAU_religious_policing_desc:0 "Policing according to religious law is the way to enforce alignment among our people. One people. One book. One God. Of course we will form a secret police to guide these guards of sharia law towards the right targets and victims."
 SAU_bolster_the_omani_imam_desc:0 "The Omani imam believed in electing a ruler, and rejected growing British political and economic control over Muscat and Oman. A recent rebellion proved them successful. So far the sultanate has been unsuccesful in regaining control. We will arm and sway these 'interior' Omanis to our side as well as helping them rise up to take control of the entirety of Oman."
 SAU_ensure_religious_alignment_desc:0 "Ensuring religious alignment between our people and our government is vital in getting us all to move and fight as one. We will invoke old ceremonies once again to re-consecrate our holy grounds."
 SAU_strengthen_the_clergy_desc:0 "The clergy is already quite powerful in Arabia, but strengthening them even further will allow us to gain the wisest of advisors and the ears of many young and old men."
 SAU_crack_down_on_tribalism_desc:0 "Cracking down on tribalism and the decentralised nature of our state is vital if we want to modernize and drag our country into the future. We will need to temper the various ambitions by tribes and families all over. It will make them less willing to go to war for us for a while, but they will see our ambitions and move on."
 SAU_royal_investments_desc:0 "Our royal family will continue investing in the region. Both financially and by the aid of our troops acting as mercenaries. Of course this will allow us to attract some scientists, ready to defect."
 SAU_religious_placation_desc:0 "With our crack down on all the movements and peoples in our country, we might need to placate the clergy. We might especially not be as popular among the lower clergy who are easily swayed by local leaders. We will have to fix them so that they don't poison the populace against us and make it harder to recruit."
 SAU_mediate_in_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen has been split for years now. The Federation of South Arabia, a federal state under British protection is occupying the south part. Her people are rowdy, turning to communism in droves. We will mediate with the British on Yemen's behalf, to see if we could unite Greater Yemen for them."
 SAU_strengthen_royal_guard_desc:0 "Strengthening the royal guard to act as the direct voice of our king will grant them additional power. This also means we need to be able to trust them, so only the best of the best could even apply. This will make it possible for the king to be everywhere all at once."
 SAU_a_change_in_government_desc:0 "A change is needed, specifically in how our government works. We will have to invoke the most direct possible rule, without any compromise or mimicry. Ancient sultans and emperors shall be our model, and we will make the islamic golden age at the swing of a sword."
 SAU_a_religious_state_desc:0 "A religious state is the only answer to the problems posed by the modern age and world. A united sunni state that fights hard and true. A state of zealots and fighters, united in true and just purpose."
 SAU_rearm_ikhwan_remnants_desc:0 "Rearming the ikhwan remnants will allow us a strong base of religious militias. We honour our past with this as well as preparing for our future. This won't be a popular move with the secularists or the progressives, but we will heed them no mind."
 SAU_security_and_faith_desc:0 "Security and faith are the core tenants of our state. Our people will need to have faith in the one true God and be protected. No bombings from the sky will threaten our people."
 SAU_align_our_puppet_governments_desc:0 "Aligning our puppet governments to the tune of our needs and wants will allow us to extract more value from them before they become one with our fledging empire."
 SAU_disband_the_shura_council_desc:0 "Disbanding the consultative assembly of Arabia will make clear to them that our ruler does not in fact need any advice our help to govern our country. There is only one true leader, one true ruler. It is not this one, the government shall be adjusted according to our wishes."
 SAU_absorb_ikhwan_remnants_desc:0 "Absorbing the ikhwan militia remnants into our army will assure that every divison, every squad, will have a zealot assuring loyalty to religious doctrine. These recruits are hardened and experienced, they will fit right in."
 SAU_ruler_led_religious_creed_desc:0 "Our ruler is the one with the final say about what our religious creed is like. Whatever he has decided in the past, he will decide what fatwas to issue and what questions to issue them about. Hell, our ruler could make us all secular if he so chooses."
 SAU_foreign_fascist_support_desc:0 "Foreign fascists have signaled they would be willing to support us, seeing how our goals and plans for the futures align. The British need to go, as well as the French. We desire no dominion of the British over the Iraqi's. We have many reasons to work together and why wouldn't we?"
 SAU_the_arabian_unification_agenda_desc:0 "Arabian unification is the most important point of our current agenda. Achieving this territorial goal will establish us as the popular movement and government. It will shut up any of the naysayers, so to speak. There's only two small parts of expansion we need to do before we manage it. Diplomacy or war? Which will it be?"
 SAU_our_northern_foe_desc:0 "Our relations with Arabia has been contentious since before even 1925 when we kicked them out of Arabia. We will have to figure out how to make sure they don't become a problem without plunging us into war with the British Empire. Will we try to isolate and blockade the Iraqi's? Work with the Turks? Or shall we try to focus on more general diplomacy?"
 SAU_seize_competing_oil_fields_desc:0 "Seizing competing oil fields will allow us to further our vice grip on the global oil markets. This makes us a force to be reckon with and one not to upset or act against. Of course for this, Iran has to fall. And so it shall be."
 SAU_their_place_in_the_empire_desc:0 "The Iranian empire has existed in some shape way or form for centuries. It is a proud people, formerly led by a modernizing Shah. Luckily, the Shah was unwise. Forgetting that he was not the Shah of France, he advised us once to let women wear miniskirts. He will pay for his misgivings and the muslim people of Iran shall welcome us gratefully. We just need to remind them."
 SAU_the_fate_of_the_levantine_states_desc:0 "France will fall, sooner or later. The levantine territories would make for a fine jewel on our crown, we shall swoop in and gather the pieces of these crumbling empires, and keep them safe. As long as we don't have the white devil spilling forth from the sea, we should be fine."
 SAU_ensure_their_loyalty_or_death_desc:0 "Speaking of empires westernising to try and find safety with the west; the turkish empire is in a sad state. Like the sick family dog we shall have to take it behind the house and muffle it's cries as it finally finishes existing. We will leave it's remains bleeding out on the mountain of Shammar. We shall feast in Ha'il this night and deploy troops in the morning."
 SAU_secure_the_horn_desc:0 "Securing the horn will allow us to finally fully secure the red sea. The red sea will colour like it's namesake when we cast the sickly remains soldiers of this failing monarch in there. A true empire needs it's colonies, does it now? It has been all the rage for centuries, we might as well get into that business."
 SAU_strike_west_desc:0 "Striking the west is a dangerous prospect. We will have to attack hard and fast and leave them reeling. We will have to storm the suez, secure Egyptian lands and then send a firmly worded letter to the British house of commons. \n\nThey will surely back down."
 SAU_the_empire_of_arabia_desc:0 "There have been many empires of Arabia. From the Rashiduns to the Umayyads, the Abbasids and the Fatimids. Never has the land conquered been so rich and fiercely defended. We will however have to choose how we would like to style ourselves. Are we a caliphate? An empire of the seas? Keepers of central asia?"
 SAU_the_prosperity_well_desc:0 "Dammam no. 7 is an oil well in Dammam. The site where commercial quantities of oil were first discovered in the country. This will mark our transformation into one of the world's leading oil producers. We are sure it will run for a century. Thank you Max Steineke for drilling so deep despite setbacks."
 SAU_riyadhi_rail_desc:0 "Our country lacks traveling and transporting infrastructure. For a country that has thousands undreds of pilgrims a year, this is unacceptable. We shall begin a great project to establish railways throughout our great country. For religious, civilian and military use."
 SAU_arabian_radio_desc:0 "Arabian radio could be a good way to reach everyone. Both media for civilian and communication for our ships, planes and infantry units. Communication is power and this is vital to our state."
 SAU_model_583_trucks_desc:0 "Railways work quite well for us, but we can't place a supply hub everywhere. Where we can't place a train station we will need trucks to ferry supplies from the rail to the men."
 SAU_engineering_schools_desc:0 "Okay it has becoming glaringly obvious that investing into engineering education in schools is vital to upschill our people. Engineers could improve our infrastructure, design weapons, repair trains. Truly the lifeblood of a modern age."
 SAU_mining_the_shield_desc:0 "The Arabian shield is filled with treasures, we will have to dig, drill and mine to get them above ground. It will be cheaper for us if we can lessen our reliance on foreign imports, so finding our own sources would help with that."
 SAU_desert_construction_desc:0 "Construction in the desert is based on ancient techniques, we are well familiar with these. Now working with concrete, steel and glass? We will fine tune our production to churn out the materials and train our builders to work faster and create more resilient structures."
 SAU_investing_oil_money_into_economy_desc:0 "Investing back into the industries with oil money will allow us to churn out more oil for our economy. This will also allow us to invest in other industries, like our light and heavy industry. This will employ more people and lift them out of poverty, improving tax gains and prestige for our country."
 SAU_arabian_cement_industry_desc:0 "Creating some sort of an Arabian cement industry will allow us to create vast foundations for huge structures. There's enough sand to bind to create this, we just have to spend the time and expertise."
 SAU_investing_in_security_desc:0 "Investing into arms factories for national use and weapon export will allow us to keep our people safe. Great tanks, rifles and more will be made here. As long as nobody is inhaling anything toxic there could not possibly be any losers to the arms trade."
 SAU_state_gold_mines_desc:0 "Gold holds a special place in Arab culture, where its beauty and value go beyond adornment to symbolize wealth, prosperity, and tradition. Gold plays a central role in various life events, religious festivities, and cultural practices. Being able to mine it ourselves is a great source of revenue for our country. We are delighted to have found a gold vein in our country."
 SAU_nationalize_the_american_oil_company_desc:0 "No foreign oil company should have us dancing to it's tune. We will nationalize the company and seize their assets. Thanks for the start of our industry, but we will take it from here. The USA won't be happy about this, but it has enough on it's mind at the moment."
 SAU_american_oil_expansion_desc:0 "Expanding the American Oil company and her activities will allow us to pump up more oil then before. This will mean greater profits and opportunities, both for us and the US. It's good to have westerners be invested to defend us in such dangerous times."
 SAU_drill_deeper_desc:0 "Drilling deeper might allow us to find more oil fields underneath our country. By stubbornly drilling incredibly deep we found the initial source, so we will just have to replicate that tactic in every suspected oil spot around our provinces and states."
 SAU_demand_greater_stake_in_the_company_desc:0 "Their company drills on our land with our engineers and our drills. Demanding a greater stake in the company only makes sense. We are supplying almost all of the value and opportunity here, we should be getting a larger cut of the profits off of it as well."
 SAU_expand_oil_production_desc:0 "Expanding oil production can be an expensive operation. Going from crude to fuel needs expansive infrastructure to be established, but we have decided it's worth to do. Our workers will have to take a bit of nightly work to get it finished on time though."
 SAU_export_infrastructure_desc:0 "Setting up export infrastructure means making sure all the rails and ports are ready to ferry large oil tank or numerous fuel barrels without risking explosions or other accidents. Once it's set up we will never be able to argue with wanting to export less of our resources, we have the means after all."
 SAU_personal_usage_desc:0 "We have need for our fuel as well, we will export less of it. Our production of planes, boats, trucks and tanks will all need to be fueled for war. Sending this fuel away from our shores to be sunk by submarines is not in our best interests at this time. Maybe after the global tensions cool down a little."
 SAU_liberal_economy_desc:0 "Our rulers have historically had a quite strong grip on our economy and trading policies. By liberalising our economy the market will instead take this role. Not closing the governments fist around the economy has it's uses too, of course. We will just have to get used to it for a little while.."
 SAU_empower_businessmen_desc:0 "Empowering arab businessmen to finance projects locally and regionally will allow us to benefit from their ever expanding wealth. Unfortunately these rich men are not very open for suggestions sometimes. We will make sure they are aware of the situation of our country, maybe they will realise what we need them to fund on their own?"
 SAU_arms_industry_desc:0 "An arms industry will allow us to benefit from local production of equipment that's currently desperately needed from a modernising armed forces. Planes? Tanks? Artillery? Yes please. We will use these to blow our enemies to pieces."
 SAU_water_taxes_desc:0 "A water tax might sound cruel but it's mere pennies, there's just a large amount of people in our country and not as much water. This allows us to benefit from this widespread consumption. Besides, those wells and the excevation required for it was not free either right? Think of like a toll bridge, it makes plenty of sense."
 SAU_invest_foreign_farmland_desc:0 "Investing in foreign farmlands is incredibly necessary, we are a dry and arid nation and we still do need food. This project will allow us to sink money into foreign farmlands and allow us as part of the contract to buy all their produce before it gets to the market."
 SAU_invest_in_command_economy_desc:0 "Creating a formalised command economy seems necessary in these modern times, altough of course whoever rules the Arabian people has a long tradition of deciding our economy and trade policies. It won't be much of a change for the people, civilian or government employees alike."
 SAU_irrigation_projects_desc:0 "Irrigation projects are a vital part in getting any sort of local farming set up within our borders. They have always been on a pretty small scale, to test out what would work. We have full confidence in this new project so we will invest majorly into this. Let's reinvigorate the Arabian farming sector!"
 SAU_central_development_desc:0 "Development guided by our seat of power is the future for our country. Local strongmen and governments don't have the full picture and other information that is transmitted to the capital. Only with all the information can you make decisions such as these."
 SAU_migrant_workers_for_arabia_desc:0 "To transform our country we need a great many skilled and unskilled workers. Educating or financing our own people to do these large project would mean it would take years. That's time we don't have, instead we will rely on migrant workers for our great national projects."
 SAU_arabian_land_forces_desc:0 "The defense ministry is needed to reorganise our army further from the ancient jihad army we used to have into a modern fighting force with a formal military structure. Our focus will be the organisation, leadership and armaments of the Arabian Land Forces."
 SAU_office_of_military_affairs_desc:0 "One of the oldest institutions within the Saudi Arabian Army, was initially known as the 'Army Administration'. It is a command office along with various departments. We will create and organise one that will focus on military affairs. For the coming time the army administration will be ever evolving in responsibilities. This is one of them."
 SAU_militarised_police_desc:0 "War police is vital to assure both garrison duties, guarding important cities and locations as well as prisoners. We will have to get these security forces formalised and informed what their role is in the future. They will also police our forces themselves as well as assure border security. For this they will reflect us deeply as a nation, so we will have to assure they are of the highest quality."
 SAU_office_of_personnel_matters_desc:0 "Founding an office of personnel matters is vital not for recruiting but for retaining soldiers. Personnel planning and budgeting will get people in positions they fit best and are compensated fairly. This also includes civilian personnel affairs like cleaners, runners and craftsmen."
 SAU_music_and_medics_desc:0 "Among other tasks, the army administration does in fact manage army music and medical services. Medical services are both for veterans and fresh recruits, active duty and retired soldiers as well as spouses and children of the enlisted. It's not quite insurance, we will just take it out of their pay. And the music is good for marches and morale!"
 SAU_reform_the_army_administration_desc:0 "We will finalise our reformation of the army administration by adding judicial systems for military personnel as well as constructing a center for receiving and recruiting new recruits in Riyadh. Now that we have all these secondary tasks met, it is time to choose how the Arabian army does war..."
 SAU_arabian_air_force_desc:0 "From the remains of the Hejaz Air Force we created the Royal Saudi Air Force. It was initially equipped with Westland Wapiti IIA general purpose aircraft flown by pilots who had served Ali of Hejaz but had been pardoned by the Saudi king. These planes have fallen in disrepair and we need to start reforming the airforcing to some certain extent."
 SAU_obtain_planes_desc:0 "To replace the Westland Wapiti IIA's who have fallen into disrepair we will need to obtain new aircraft. We will reach out to the British and see if we could acquire some biplane fighter planes that they are phasing out by any time. The Gloster Gladiator Mk. I seems to be replaced even though it's only a mere couple years old. We could work with that for now!"
 SAU_improve_airfield_infrastructure_desc:0 "We have a contract with the British who promised to finalise a military airstrip, we will remind them of this contract and their promise. This new airstrip will be the airforce headquarters, the secondary one will be one where we can fall back to."
 SAU_red_sea_navy_desc:0 "We will need to craft a true and worthy sea navy to secure our parts of the red sea up to the suez channel. For this we need to learn about ships and ship doctrine as well as constructing an expansive initial dockyard for us to create warships."
 SAU_obtain_destroyers_and_subs_desc:0 "To protect against pirates and other interdictions to our trade we will send out merchants and diplomats abroad to acquire secondhand destroyers and subs. The great powers have been caught up in making the most modern and strongest ships they can within the martitime law, they must have some laying around that aren't up to their modern standards anymore."
 SAU_red_sea_doctrine_desc:0 "To patrol our waters bordering the red sea effectively we will have to develop a naval doctrine that will allow us to project our naval strength. We have put our smartest minds to develop one, while taking some notes from foreign navies that we have been able to observe."
 SAU_purchage_old_dreadnoughts_desc:0 "Dreadnoughts are an older type of battleship while we could develop our own, this would take a decade. What wouldn't take a decade is buying some of them from other nations. Germany for example, isn't allowed to have theirs anymore anyways. We will buy some old ships and strip them down a little so that they will be allowed under the Washington Naval Treaty, just in case."
 SAU_old_foreign_naval_plans_desc:0 "Voices have begun to pop up in favor of the creation of some bigger ships; larger than anything we have previously built or designed. With fireugb good-will they might provide us with the plans for ships as such, allowing us to use these as a basis from which to create our own designs. These ships would surely deter any attack on our shores."
 SAU_dockyard_construction_desc:0 "Navy dockyards are state owned harbour facilities where ships of the navy are built, based, repaired and refitted. They are quite expansive industrial complexes that is vital to invest in if we want to get our fledgling navy up to any kind of standards. With the plans we got we could actually start buidling ships here instead of just convoys."
 SAU_raiding_forth_from_the_seas_desc:0 "Amphibious warfare is vital for naval ships to project ground and air power onto a hostile or potentially hostile shore at a designated landing beach. Training our desert people how to use these landing ships and how to get used to the transition between naval and ground movement. Giving our soldiers sea legs, essentially."
 SAU_trapping_the_seas_desc:0 "Trapping the seas around our peninsula with naval mine will be able to allow us to damage or even destroy surface ships or submarines without risking any arab lives along the way. The more shores we can push these mines into the sea from, the more we shall do so. We would like to reduce the amount of garrisons needed in favour of allowing our men to actually fight on the front instead."
 SAU_naval_academy_desc:0 "Naval academies are a place for us to educate admirals for our fleet and captains for our ships. Having highly educated officers will allow our fleet to adapt quickly to the catastrophic effects of a collapsing command structure due to specific ships being sunk, like those carrying our most senior officers."
 SAU_protect_trade_ports_desc:0 "Protecting our trade ports is vital for us to do our oil exporting business. While our fleet or mines should keep us from being blockaded we should also assure that no invading army is able to land on our shores to sabotage our ports or take them for their own."
 SAU_coastal_defence_batteries_desc:0 "Coastal artillery is an ancient concept that has been around since the middle ages. Cannons are vital to keep ships out. In our case; coastal artillery to make a landing as painful as possible for invading forces. While they won't be focused on sinking ships, they will blow up people by the dozens while they try to wade onto our shores."
 SAU_limited_intervention_desc:0 "While we are hesitant to throw our people into a second great war for some idealogical reason, what we can do as an organisation is organise forces for limited foreign intervention, assuring whichever side we decide to support has a slightly less tough time in this war. Our people can for example function as coastal garrisons, or sabotage counter maneuvers done by the enemy."
 SAU_shared_intelligence_desc:0 "Intelligence shared is intelligence doubled. To anticipate what our league might need to do to continue to exist we must be informed. Allowing all our members to make informed decisions about political, economical and military dilemmas. It is a complicated world out there, we must learn and adapt to make it work for us."
 SAU_league_armed_forces_desc:0 "By integrating our armed forces on some basic level, we will be able to coordinate and communicate among our troops. We shall all command with the arab tongue and train our troops to the same standard. Hell, we probably will be able to learn from each other's terrain, approaches and doctrine."
 SAU_economic_integration_desc:0 "By more closely integrating our collective industries we will have more funding than we know what to do this. Among other things this will allow us to improve our military and civilian supply routes, and ease fueling our motorised forces."
 SAU_cast_down_the_imperialists_desc:0 "While this all seems an awful lot like a eurasian affair, we know from experience that an imperialist will not cease and will keep fighting until they have conquered everything. Unless you stop them, that is. We will have to get involved in this great conflict and get rid of these upstarts while we have the opportunity. At least for now we might have some allies that could provide an ample distraction."
 SAU_secure_our_economic_system_desc:0 "While the second great war is being fought in eurasia this could be the opportunity for us to secure our economic system from further communist interference. Sure, we aren't great fans of the fascists, but they are also after power and money. We understand that, we can deal with that. These communist we do not understand and what we don't understand we can't help but fear. We shall invade the leftist scourges and cast them down."
 SAU_federalise_the_league_desc:0 "The league has grown ever stronger and closer. While this might not be the arab movement in the way that some might have expected it, some of our people have started calling for unification. While we aren't quite there yet, we shall nonetheless draw closer and become a great federation of countries. We will gain control over their political decisions and their armed forces for now."
 SAU_deepened_cooperation_desc:0 "We are allied to one another, there is reason for us to learn from each other while we are at it already. Cooperation would only benefit both of us, after all. Many countries have either developed, borrowed or stolen technology we have not yet acquired or have specific troop specialisations we can't help but be excited to learn about."
 SAU_arabian_flight_schools_desc:0 "We have been sending our pilots to train in British flight schools for years now. Now that we have our airforce's headquarters set up, naturally we will start building the school near our secondary airfield. This way if our airforce gets bombed, we will still have the younger and newer pilots safely tucked away."
 SAU_naval_air_escorts_desc:0 "Air escorts for our navy will help our interservice response time. The planes could inform the ships and start their attack and the navy can swoop in and finish off the stragglers, or the other way around of course. Some British planes for this would work the best, we are sure they know best in matters related to the ocea, with an empire like theirs..."
 SAU_military_research_desc:0 "Military research is vital to stay on the cutting edge of regional and even international warfare. Our edge in armored warfare helped us greatly in crushing the Yemeni forces in 1937 so we have alwayys understood technological superiority to be important. However as a newer nation we will have to balance obtaining technology from western 'benefactors' and starting to research and create national versions and alternatives."
 SAU_foreign_volunteering_desc:0 "Volunteering internationally will allow our forces to breed solidarity with workers near and far, fighting for their future and movement. We can't always get stuck in at every minor regional scuffle, but assisting idealogical allies in their conflict is always worth it. We would appreciate the same, after all."
 SAU_arabian_socialism_in_one_country_desc:0 "Arabian socialism in one country is exactly what it sounds like. While we will allow a certain level of autonomy for worker's republics within our border, one large arabian union in our region would be for the best. We will integrate or annex the puppet governments nearby that we have dominion over. They will benefit from everything our great nation can offer them and we will benefit from their resources and manpower."
 SAU_incorporate_kurd_desc:0 "Integrating the kurdish movement is the logical step in assuring security for the long oppressed Kurdish people. They have been largely liberated and shall forever more be a safe and protected group within our socialist union of peoples. They bring with them an expansive history and slew of traditions that we can surely learn from."
 SAU_align_regional_communists_desc:0 "Now that we have liberated workers in the region, we must assure that we are aligned in doctrine and purpose. We should make sure that they believe in the same interpetation of marxists-leninist ideals as we do. On top of that we will offer them security, it can be awfully dangerous for a minor communist nation surrounded by other, more powerful and larger nations."
 SAU_rescue_the_azer_from_the_russian_boot_desc:0 "Liberating the regions where the azerbaijani's can be found will allow them the local self-government that they have wished for for so long. We will request that these regions will be united under our banner."
 SAU_forced_modernisation_desc:0 "Modernisation is a slow and unpopular process. Luckily with the power granted to our government, we will be able to force it through. Our secret police shall make sure that this won't affect the stability of our country at all. New tanks and airplanes shall spread through our lands and keep the people sedated. For our people there are only two decisions; into the factories or the research banks. Unless of course they are conscripted."
 SAU_infiltration_and_deceit_desc:0 "Infiltration and deceit are weapons as old as humanity. You know what else is as old as humanity? Resistance. We will infiltrate local arabian populations and stir them up against the British. It's not easy to anger them against the injustice and suppression that they recieve at the hands of these westerners."
 SAU_fast_tank_tactics_desc:0 "We firmly believe that lightning warfare is the future. Combined arms suprise attacks using rapid and overwhelming force concentration will help us break through enemy lines regardless of how dug in they have made themselves. Rapidly break through, create encirclements and destroy the enemy."
 SAU_engineering_shortcuts_desc:0 "There are some things we could do make our tanks cheaper and still function almost identical from it's more 'proper' counterparts. We oculd change the chassis design, create engines that are simpler and also used in other vehicles. We could have more rudimentary suspensions and fire control systems and have transmissions made of lower grade metals."
 SAU_raiding_infantry_battallions_desc:0 "Depredation tactics allows foir us to do operational 'smash and grab' missions. Not intended to hold but to quickly move in and retreat where needed. Our infantry could easily adjust to learn from this. The Islamic prophet Muhammad made frequent use of raiding tactics, we are aware of it's history. Owning it would grant our soldiers great pride."
 SAU_supply_networks_desc:0 "Supplying your troops is vital to winning the war, Napoleon should've known this, Sun Tzu knew this, and we know this. Streamlining our support networks will allow us to get what we need from furhter away. Fed and armed troops are a lot more effective than the alternative."
 SAU_camelry_cavalry_desc:0 "Camelry and horse cavalry has a long history in our country, bedouin soldiers of the Ikhwan army used them extensively. For us it's perfectly natural to improve these divisions and their doctrine to use in modern times as well. Other nations might use camels for police and patrol, but we know better."
 SAU_the_arabian_war_desc:0 "Arabian warriors are the proudest and fiercest soldiers on the peninsula, this major reform is just another proof of this. Our army is well supplied and equipped, strikes hard and moves fast. Many Arabian tanks are ready to flood over the arab lands with righteous fury."
 SAU_modern_tank_tactics_desc:0 "Modern tank tactics can't work without technologically competent tanks. We will reform and reorganise our tank divisions to work together more effectively on the battlefield. This will allow us to destroy as many enemies as we require to achieve our objectives."
 SAU_tank_engineering_desc:0 "Investing extensively into combat vehicle engineering will allow us to create tanks with improved armor and more effective anti-tank cannons. This will allow us to go toe-to-toe with British, German or Soviet armored forces while keeping our tank crews safe from anyone piercing through their armor."
 SAU_defensive_infantry_positions_desc:0 "Focusing our armored forces, both tanks and mobile infantry as offensive units that intend to break through, means we only have limited units to spare. The rest of our army shall have to hold defensive positions and await their turn in a grand encirclement or other operation."
 SAU_armored_infantry_desc:0 "Armored infantry, or mechanised infantry are infantry units organised with some form of personnel carriers. This will allow our units to strike hard as always, but also swiftly and deep within enemy lines. Motorising or mechanising our infantry will also allow us to save lifes. Swift and armored units don't get destroyed as easily and can escape scary situations."
 SAU_efficient_oil_usage_desc:0 "With our focus on tanks and mechanised infantry a focus will have to be established on efficient oil usage. Of course we produce plenty of oil, but stretching it and using it wisely will allow us to balance exports and military usage."
 SAU_arabian_doctrine_desc:0 "The swift arabian doctrine allows us to breakthrough and encircle units with ease. The total annihilation of the enemy is the only way to win wars in the region. Quality tanks will allow us to smash lines in natural chokeholds in the middle east. We will be unstoppable!"
 SAU_seizing_battlefield_equipment_desc:0 "Training our troops in depth about how weapons work more generally allow us to equip them with found or otherwise obtained foreign equipment. If we have to make a couple weapons less, then that's probably for the best, right?"
 SAU_interservice_cooperation_desc:0 "Cooperation between army branches will allow both branches to be stronger. With active infantry troops as scout movements while air support also assists infantry with bombing enemy troops. Infantry on the ground could push with the support of close air support would become much more powerful than it could on it's own."
 SAU_air_security_desc:0 "By focusing on fighters we could assure security in the air for our people. We could make sure no bombers could devestate our people and infrastructure, while also allowing us to make sure the enemy gets no close air support."
 SAU_bomber_tactics_desc:0 "By focusing on fighters we could devestate the enemy from the air. We could make sure no factories could produce weapons to attack our people and infrastructure, while also allowing us to make sure the enemy keeps no functioning anti-air support."
 SAU_weapon_development_bomber_desc:0 "Unmanned planes filled to the brim with bombs? Sure we would need to try to get the cost down, but at least the cost of lives is low! We will dedicate a full facility to the development of this idea. We will have to recruit some local scientists to field these positions."
 SAU_weapon_development_desc:0 "To create great weapons we will dedicate a full facility to the development of them. We will have to recruit some local scientists to field these positions. We could create better, bigger, stronger planes for our airforce with their help."
 SAU_composite_materials_desc:0 "To make a great airfleet we would need to try to get the cost down. We could do this by getting our hands on local equivalents or composites. \nThe development of this is costly, so it's a question of prioritising the right industrial investments to make."
 SAU_arabian_airforce_final_desc:0 "The arabian airforce is a force in the region to be reckoned with. It keeps our skies clear, our enemies cowering and broken and keeps us in the fight for much longer than any enemy might expect. Our mighty airmen will do their job valiantly and proudly. With such a prestigious career, people flock to the recruitment offices to have a chance to soar high above the desert."
 SAU_reduce_pilot_reliance_desc:0 "While a great airforce is good for us, it will be hard to catch up with the great western powers of the world, or the Russians. We will have to make sure that we product and fill enough planes, sure. But this is also a great drain on our manpower, so to alleviate this somewhat we will create great anti-air installations to assure that we maybe need to run slightly less interception missions. Anti-air cannons last longer than the average Arabian fighter after all..."
 SAU_army_organisation_desc:0 "The military affairs office has undergone a major reforganisation. This more streamlined structure helps with religious or idealogical affairs, medical service and personnel. This helps keep our soldiers on task and active. Where there is room for doubt to creep in, we will stand vigilant to shake off this threat to our effectiveness."
 SAU_army_rations_desc:0 "Keeping our army fed is second only to keeping our army supplied with bullets. While a soldier won't last a day without a loaded rifle or other weapon, he won't last two days without a full belly. Fighting takes energy and energy comes from regular chow and sleep times. While our soldiers are trained to sleep anywhere, they can't live off of sand. They will need tuna, beef, cheese, noodles, crackers, dates, nuts and more. Supplying them with this is quite an operation, one that is worth investing in."
 SAU_a_coastal_navy_desc:0 "Developing arabian coastal doctrines allow us to prioritise defence and near shore raiding over international and abroad operations. We need to not have our enemy march into our capital. Our allies will deal with the threat from far away, we will focus on securing our regional objectives."
 SAU_prowling_the_waters_desc:0 "Prowling the seas around our nation with locally developed submarines will allow us to both deploy reconnaissance and disruption fleets. It will allow us to interupt trade, troop convoys and inform us beforehand if a large fleet comes over to bombard our shores."
 SAU_improved_ship_construction_desc:0 "Improved ship construction will allow us to construct more ships locally without relying on the whims of foreign naval powers. Digging out more dockyards to employ our people to create large fleets of ships to project strength across the red sea, the arabian sea and the persian gulf. We will learn from our initial dockyard construction to make this project go better then before."
 SAU_arabian_destroyers_desc:0 "We will expand great destroyer units from our shipyards will allow us to defend our shores from enemy intervention. We will allow torpedo's to lance out and sink any enemy ships lost on their way home. In the future we will be able to get quite a bit of return on investment by fishing up the scrap left by these foolish ships."
 SAU_arabian_coastal_fleet_desc:0 "The Arabian coastal fleet is active all hours a day, keeping our shores safe from invasion and our people safe from foreign invaders. While it's not the strongest or biggest navy in the world, it does exactly what it's set out to do."
 SAU_ocean_crossings_desc:0 "An ocean crossing navy allows us to intervene far from home, deep in the heartland of our enemy. Projecting strength internationally is done still primarily through naval power. To take our rightful place on the global stage this is the path we will have to take."
 SAU_secure_shippinglanes_desc:0 "Securing our trade shipping lanes from threats will need to be done by deploying destroyers armed with depth charges. This will allow us to hunt down submarines that could threaten the trade of our oil and the transportation of our troops. The suez and the red sea is a famed and internationally important naval area, so major naval powers will be securing it for us. We just need to catch whoever slips through their nets."
 SAU_cruiser_development_desc:0 "Domestic cruiser development will be a grand project. Ships never made this sizeable on our shores before will be dominating the local seas. Researching these projects will take a while but we will be able to learn greatly from any foreign ships we could get our hands on before now."
 SAU_indian_ocean_fleet_desc:0 "The indian ocean fleet is the nickname of our fleet due to it being the place where we train. From formations to operations, we will be able to deploy our cruisers and destroyers from near to far. No shore is safe from us and no navy or country can push us around unpunished."
 SAU_expand_airfleet_purchasing_desc:0"Further airfleet purchasing will be done to get our hands on more planes for our airforce. Our factories are busy creating other military equipment, we can't currently spare enough time and effort to import the rubber and alumium rquired to create this planes for ourselves. Maybe in the long term this will change, but for now we will just purchase the equipment required to get and keep our pilots in the air."

 ASJ_request_a_home_guard_desc:0 "We must be able to defend ourselves, we will reach out to our overlord to request permission to raise some local militias up to the national level. We will solidate control over these units at deploy them in defence of our country and the empire that governs us."
 ASJ_armament_investments_desc:0 "To properly arm and equip our troops we must invest extensively into local armament production. A military factory allows us to make rifles locally instead of importing them from our overlord or other countries. Safer too, as there is no opportunity for submarines will intercept our convoys."
 ASJ_raf_station_bases_desc:0 "Airforces from both us and our overlord will need stations and bases to land. On top of this we need to be able to construct planes as well as the knowledge to create planes and develop doctrines for our airforce. This is the start of keeping our own skies clear, by ourselves and for ourselves."
 ASJ_conscription_centres_desc:0 "Conscription centres will create a central place for us to funnel recruits to. While some might be volunteers, the majority wil be conscripted int oour armed forces. Wether on land, water, or in the sea, people drive our military efforts. These centers will be filled to the brim with propaganda to properly incentivize loyal service."
 ASJ_prioritize_internal_affairs_desc:0 "Of course we will have to prioritize internal affairs before we are really able to commit to the operations and plans of our overlord. Not being an independent nation assures that some local militias think they can fuck with the government, it's time to prove them wrong. We will deputise loyal local groups or otherwise militarise the police to keep them in check."
 ASJ_follow_the_master_doctrine_desc:0 "Follow the master's doctrine for warfare would be for the best, they have deep and expansive knowledge about how to properly conduct a war. Some trainers and attaches could really help us wrap our brain around the best way of doing war, of sending our troops in under the righteous sound of gunfire and rains of artillery shrapnel."
 ASJ_the_new_age_of_warfare_desc:0 "A modern day has come and new age of warfare has arrived with it. New armies are fast, strike fast and destroy totally. Trucks, tanks and armored cars encricle and control enemy troops. We will learn from foreign ways of war and adapt before even our overlord can."
 ASJ_land_arm_of_the_middle_east_desc:0 "Only one of these arabian subjects can really be the primary land army of the middle east. To establish ourselves as such is a real honour and will allow us to erect a grand research facility to develop new technologies. We will be able to dominate any enemies around us. \nDesert warfare isn't quite the same as the trench warfare our overlord is used to."
 ASJ_home_grown_pilots_desc:0 "Training pilots at home will be able to reduce the drain on our national resources to keep sending our men to our overlord to practice. Being able to train locally will also allow us to develop our airforce's doctrine, adjusted to the actual environments that it would operate in. \nFlying above a desert isn't the same as above green hills."
 ASJ_aquire_planes_desc:0 "Acquiring some planes from the British will allow us to establish the initial structure of our airforce. We will of course deconstruct a couple planes to learn from them and develop some planes for our own national production."
 ASJ_aeronautical_arm_of_the_middle_east_desc:0 "Only one of these arabian subjects can really be the primary airforce of the middle east. To establish ourselves as such is a real honour and will allow us to erect a grand research facility to develop new technologies.  \nWe will be able to dominate any enemies around us."
 ASJ_a_port_with_a_country_desc:0 "We are a country on the coast, a port with a country. It's the lifeblood of our country, it's from where we get support from our overlord from, but it's also where from we are bled dry. Wether we'd ever become independent, or be plunged into war, it is vital for us to have control over our ports."
 ASJ_foreign_educators_desc:0 "Educators from far away could be invited to our country to further our development. While it could influence our people towards our overlord's idealogy, it could also better our country, it will stablise and modernise our country."
 ASJ_sailor_clubs_desc:0 "Training sailors at home will be able to reduce the drain on our national resources to keep sending our men to our overlord to practice. Being able to train locally will also allow us to develop our naval doctrine, adjusted to the actual environments that it would operate in. \nThe red sea isn't the north sea, after all."
 ASJ_develop_trade_routes_desc:0 "As a subject, our value is primarily in enabling and feeding imperial trade routes from and to our country. For this we need a dockyard to churn out convoys continuously. Both for trade and for transporting our troops to foreign frontlines, the convoys are the lifeblood of our country being able to exist."
 ASJ_overlord_trade_desc:0 "Trade to our overlord is what keeps them off of our back and guarantees our contious survival as a semi-autonomous nation in this ever changing modern world. If we get to survive long enough, we can lobby and plead for our independence. \n\nMaybe it's for the best, for now."
 ASJ_a_fleet_to_protect_our_interests_desc:0 "Establishing an arabian fleet to protect ourselves and our overlord's interests in the region will be instrumental. Requesting a license to create destroyers and getting some already made ships from the British will be our initial direction. And it's only the beginning."
 ASJ_naval_arm_of_the_middle_east_desc:0 "Only one of these arabian subjects can really be the primary navy of the middle east. To establish ourselves as such is a real honour and will allow us to erect a grand research facility to develop new technologies. \n\nWe will be able to dominate any enemies around our seas."
 ASJ_building_a_nation_from_nothing_desc:0 "Building a nation from nothing takes a great deal of work, we will have to establish institutions. These rules and structures legitimise our rule, popularise our movement and allow us to gather investment for civilian construction."
 ASJ_connecting_the_country_desc:0 "Of course our overlord would desire for us to improve the country's infrastructure so they could more efficiently extract our resources. However there is a positive side to this, better infrastructure is also good for our people."
 ASJ_promoting_industrialisation_desc:0 "Promoting industrialisation within our country is vital to making us a modern and properly working nation. We will see if there's resources we can find to extract for our own profit as well as creating space for factories through land reform."
 ASJ_seek_master_investments_desc:0 "Seeking investments from our overlord to our capital will centralise our rule and allow us to project power throughout our country. On top of that it will force more people towards the capital city, which allows us to conscript or otherwise put to work those that are willing."
 ASJ_generic_banking_focus_desc:0 "The [FROM.GetName] national bank, or the 'central bank' manages the monetary policy of our coutnry. It increases the monetary base and supervises our local commercial banks, on top of regulation it also loans to these banks and gives them guidance on local loan policies. Without a central bank we can't control and steer the local banks to effectively enable our people and businesses."
 ASJ_general_rearmament_desc:0 "A general rearmament is required, our troops lack everything from more specialised equipment to the basic rifle. With our overlord busy with their own rearmament, we will have to shift our efforts to be domestic. We will get arms facotries on our soil, churning out the equipment we need."
 ASJ_preparing_for_the_worst_desc:0 "We have got to be prepared for the worst, which is not just a lengthy great war but also our overlord being invaded or worse... Military and naval as well as industrial might should be raised and that needs a huge amount of equipment. To produce these we need dockyards, military as well as civilian factories."
 ASJ_protectors_of_the_levant_desc:0 "We have established ourselves as the protectors of the middle east. For us to make this come true we will need to field advanced military units and fully equip them. For this we need military factories raised in our lands at the scale we have never done so before. This is the only way to keep us all safe."
 ASJ_two_sea_program_desc:0 "We have established ourselves as the protectors of the seas. For us to make this come true we will need to field advanced military ships and fully equip them. For this we need naval dockyards created in our lands at the scale we have never done so before. This is the only way to keep us all safe."
 ASJ_boring_projects_desc:0 "Extraction projects to retrieve resources from our country is vital for any kind of war or economy effort. We need these resources for both our and our overlord's war machine. It will be easy to get them to spare the resources for us to dig or pomp these vital resources up and ready for use and export."
 ASJ_reinvigorate_civillian_industry_desc:0 "We have a proud local traditional industry, even in the modern age we need to protect our civilian industry. But in the spirit of progression we might need to modernise it a little and make sure it has a future. Our people and our traditions are vital to the culture we proudly display to anyone who comes by."
 ASJ_the_path_to_dominionship_desc:0 "The path to becoming a dominion is a long and hard one. Being a dominion allows us largely self-governance. It would make us a lot more independent from our foreign distant rulers and gives us more leeway in what we could or could not do."
 ASJ_old_grudges_desc:0 "While some nations have not been independent for long, territorial claims and other grudges are usually centuries old. The Sykes–Picot Agreement is only the most recent catalysts for these problems. Our people don't see eye to eye with it's neighbors and we claim their lands. It's a tale as old as time. Given the opportunity, we would take these lands for ourselves."
 ASJ_the_communist_agitation_desc:0 "Communist agitation isn't a suprise. We are a colony of a foreign power and it is understandable for our people to gravitate to a movement that disavows imperialism and colonialism. Our people are clamouring for freedom, liberation and land reform. The power of our ruler and the clergy doesn't help either."
 ASJ_strengthening_the_emirate_desc:0 "The Amirate of Trans-Jordan is currently a autonomous governing system within the British Mandate for Palestine. Strengthening it and becoming a true emirate will allow our ruler increased prestige and allow our people to rally behind him."
 
 TAN_building_an_economy_from_nothing_desc:0 "Building a nation from nothing takes a great deal of work, we will have to establish our initial factories. This structure legitimise our efforts, popularise our movement and allow us to gather investment for civilian construction."

 TAN_request_military_training_desc:0 "We must be able to defend ourselves, we will reach out to our allies to request help to raise some local militias up to the national level. We will solidate control over these units at deploy them in defence of our country and to defend against the empires that envelop us."
 TAN_armament_investments_desc:0 "To properly arm and equip our troops we must invest extensively into local armament production. A military factory allows us to make rifles locally instead of importing them from our allies or other countries. Safer too, as there is no opportunity for submarines will intercept our convoys."
 TAN_faction_air_bases_desc:0 "Airforces from both us and our allies will need stations and bases to land. On top of this we need to be able to construct planes as well as the knowledge to create planes and develop doctrines for our airforce. This is the start of keeping our own skies clear, by ourselves and for ourselves."
 TAN_conscription_centres_desc:0 "Conscription centres will create a central place for us to funnel recruits to. While some might be volunteers, the majority wil be conscripted int oour armed forces. Wether on land, water, or in the sea, people drive our military efforts. These centers will be filled to the brim with propaganda to properly incentivize loyal service."
 TAN_prioritize_internal_affairs_desc:0 "Of course we will have to prioritize internal affairs before we are really able to commit to the operations and plans of our allies. Not being a large nation assures that some local militias think they can fuck with the government, it's time to prove them wrong. We will deputise loyal local groups or otherwise militarise the police to keep them in check."
 TAN_a_shared_doctrine_desc:0 "Follow the tried and tested doctrine for warfare would be for the best, many nations have deep and expansive knowledge about how to properly conduct a war. Some trainers and attaches could really help us wrap our brain around the best way of doing war, of sending our troops in under the righteous sound of gunfire and rains of artillery shrapnel."
 TAN_the_new_age_of_warfare_desc:0 "A modern day has come and new age of warfare has arrived with it. New armies are fast, strike fast and destroy totally. Trucks, tanks and armored cars encricle and control enemy troops. We will learn from foreign ways of war and adapt before even our allies can."
 TAN_land_forces_for_asia_desc:0 "Only one of these subjects can really be the primary land army of the east. To establish ourselves as such is a real honour and will allow us to erect a grand research facility to develop new technologies. We will be able to dominate any enemies around us. \nDesert warfare isn't quite the same as the trench warfare our overlord is used to."
 TAN_home_grown_pilots_desc:0 "Training pilots at home will be able to reduce the drain on our national resources to keep sending our men to our allies to practice. Being able to train locally will also allow us to develop our airforce's doctrine, adjusted to the actual environments that it would operate in. \nFlying above a desert isn't the same as above green hills."
 TAN_aquire_planes_desc:0 "Acquiring some planes from the Russians will allow us to establish the initial structure of our airforce. We will of course deconstruct a couple planes to learn from them and develop some planes for our own national production."
 TAN_aeronautical_forces_for_asia_desc:0 "Only one of these nations around can really be the primary airforce of asia. To establish ourselves as such is a real honour and will allow us to erect a grand research facility to develop new technologies.  \nWe will be able to dominate any enemies around us."
 TAN_a_port_for_our_country_desc:0 "We are a country on the coast, a port with a country. It's the lifeblood of our country, it's from where we get support from from, but it's also where from we could be bled dry. Wether we'd ever become independent, or be plunged into war, it is vital for us to have control over our ports."
 TAN_foreign_educators_desc:0 "Educators from far away could be invited to our country to further our development. While it could influence our people towards our idealogy, it could also better our country, it will stablise and modernise our country."
 TAN_sailor_clubs_desc:0 "Training sailors at home will be able to reduce the drain on our national resources to keep sending our men to our allies to practice. Being able to train locally will also allow us to develop our naval doctrine, adjusted to the actual environments that it would operate in. \nThe japanese sea isn't the north sea, after all."
 TAN_develop_trade_routes_desc:0 "As a smaller nation, our value is primarily in enabling and feeding larger trade routes from and to our country. For this we need a dockyard to churn out convoys continuously. Both for trade and for transporting our troops to foreign frontlines, the convoys are the lifeblood of our country being able to exist."
 TAN_a_fleet_to_protect_our_interests_desc:0 "Establishing a fleet to protect ourselves and our allies' interests in the region will be instrumental. Requesting a license to create destroyers and getting some already made ships from the British will be our initial direction. And it's only the beginning."
 TAN_naval_forces_for_asia_desc:0 "To establish ourselves as such a power in the east is a real honour and will allow us to erect a grand research facility to develop new technologies. \n\nWe will be able to dominate any enemies around our seas."
 TAN_building_a_nation_from_nothing_desc:0 "Building a nation from nothing takes a great deal of work, we will have to establish institutions. These rules and structures legitimise our rule, popularise our movement and allow us to gather investment for civilian construction."
 TAN_connecting_the_country_desc:0 "Of course our allies would desire for us to improve the country's infrastructure so they could more efficiently extract our resources. However there is a positive side to this, better infrastructure is also good for our people."
 TAN_promoting_industrialisation_desc:0 "Promoting industrialisation within our country is vital to making us a modern and properly working nation. We will see if there's resources we can find to extract for our own profit as well as creating space for factories through land reform."
 TAN_seek_foreign_investments_desc:0 "Seeking investments from our allies to our capital will centralise our rule and allow us to project power throughout our country. On top of that it will force more people towards the capital city, which allows us to conscript or otherwise put to work those that are willing."
 TAN_generic_banking_focus_desc:0 "The [FROM.GetName] national bank, or the 'central bank' manages the monetary policy of our coutnry. It increases the monetary base and supervises our local commercial banks, on top of regulation it also loans to these banks and gives them guidance on local loan policies. Without a central bank we can't control and steer the local banks to effectively enable our people and businesses."
 TAN_general_rearmament_desc:0 "A general rearmament is required, our troops lack everything from more specialised equipment to the basic rifle. With our allies busy with their own rearmament, we will have to shift our efforts to be domestic. We will get arms facotries on our soil, churning out the equipment we need."
 TAN_preparing_for_the_worst_desc:0 "We have got to be prepared for the worst, which is not just a lengthy great war but also our allies being invaded or worse... Military and naval as well as industrial might should be raised and that needs a huge amount of equipment. To produce these we need dockyards, military as well as civilian factories."
 TAN_protectors_of_the_east_desc:0 "We have established ourselves as the protectors of asia. For us to make this come true we will need to field advanced military units and fully equip them. For this we need military factories raised in our lands at the scale we have never done so before. This is the only way to keep us all safe."
 TAN_the_sea_program_desc:0 "We have established ourselves as the protectors of the seas. For us to make this come true we will need to field advanced military ships and fully equip them. For this we need naval dockyards created in our lands at the scale we have never done so before. This is the only way to keep us all safe."
 TAN_boring_projects_desc:0 "Extraction projects to retrieve resources from our country is vital for any kind of war or economy effort. We need these resources for both our and our allies's war machine. It will be easy to get them to spare the resources for us to dig or pomp these vital resources up and ready for use and export."
 TAN_reinvigorate_civillian_industry_desc:0 "We have a proud local traditional industry, even in the modern age we need to protect our civilian industry. But in the spirit of progression we might need to modernise it a little and make sure it has a future. Our people and our traditions are vital to the culture we proudly display to anyone who comes by."

 TAN_enforcing_state_atheism_desc:0 "Enforcing state atheism has been something Kuular fought against for years, but we will get rid of the outdated classes of Lama's and the monastaries that house them. They are no longer needed in a modern age and are only holding our people back."
