 MON_refuge_from_war_desc:0 "There is war and slaughter rippling across asian nations. We will open our borders to welcome in refugees. They will get shelter, work and a select few will be permitted to serve in our armed forces to keep us safe. If it comes to it, they might be able to take vengeance."
 MON_war_refuge_tt:0 "This focus will give you manpower and state population for each asian nation that is at war."
 MON_continue_modernisation_desc:0 "We will continue the modernisation of our army as started by the former general chief commander Gelegdorjiin Demid, being stuck in the path would not serve us well. We refuse to become such a medieval mess like the Boxer Uprising."
 MON_modern_infantry_desc:0 "On the modern battlefield, infantry will have to hold and attack in rapidly changing and challenging scenarios. We will teach our sergeants and troopers how to adequately respond in stressful situations and how to make the most of them. This way our infantry will be prepared and ready, eager to spring a devestating counterattack."
 MON_supported_infantry_desc:0 "Mere rifles and bullets don't finish wars alone, anymore. We will need to support our infantry with great guns. Piercing the sky, bombarding from above or blowing through tanks. Equipment is the most vital part of a soldier's arsenal."
 MON_modern_warfare_desc:0 "Our army is ready for any modern conflict, moving swiftly and professionally eliminating any resistance before it. Our tanks will roll over countless enemy trenches and destroy their fortifications as if it was nothing. Opposition will be futile in the face of the forces of [MON.GetLeader]!"
 MON_higher_standards_desc:0 "All around us are nations with armies being used as disposable fodder. In China when there is a small conflict, millions die. We can not afford this, so we will hold our generals and army to a higher standard. No lives will be thrown away in vain and every dead Mongol will have to be justified in direct positive effect."
 MON_advanced_army_technology_desc:0 "Our army is being picked up out of a slump, but it is time to start moving onto the cutting edge. Howitzers larger than life, great bunker systems, artillery as large as a flat, tanks as big as a Mongolian village. All you can dream of and more; we will build."
 MON_modernize_stockpile_desc:0 "A lot of what we have in our stockpiles are barely functioning old Soviet weapons from a long time ago, some even from the time the Russian Empire existed. We will have to produce modern arms to replace these relics of the past. And don't worry, we'll fix these relics up and keep them in reserve, just in case."
 MON_faster_forces_desc:0 "Motorizing our armed personnel will allow us to rapidly respond to minor rebellions, and deserters on a small scale. On a larger scale this will allow us to overrun enemy positions."
 MON_a_mongol_tank_desc:0 "Due to our history with the Soviets we have some licenses to build tanks, but we want to develop our own. We will take their tanks as a starting point and make them faster, better armored, with bigger guns. Tanks that embody our great state."
 MON_mongolian_tank_force_desc:0 "Now that we have developed our tank technology we will start forming Mongolian tank divsions and train them relentlessly to break through enemy lines and encircle their troops. These armored divisions will support our troops as an elite striking force."
 MON_altay_mountain_training_desc:0 "Mongolia has three major mountain ranges, the highest is the altay mountains which stretch across the west and southwest regions. We will train our infantry here to the highest level and have them train to employ mountain cannons."
 MON_invite_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "There's many in foreign lands that have dedicated their lives to inventing military doctrines and pushing their idea of how an army should look like. We will invite them and allow them to form a think tank that will advise us on how to reform our doctrines for our navy, army and airforce."
 MON_scavenge_arms_desc:0 "There's no reason to leave all that equipment with the corpses of our enemies. We will instruct our troops to take whatever they can carry at the end of the battle and bring it to their quartermasters. The quartermasters will convert small arms to calibers that we normally use and convert artillery and tanks to use shells we produce."
 MON_traditional_warfare_desc:0 "There's a reason modernizing is sometimes called getting on 'the bleeding edge'. Like a knife, experimentation can cut deep. We will instead focus on proven methods from our own history and that of our neighbours."
 MON_support_cavalry_desc:0 "Sure we have a long history of cavalry, but horses don't do too well in all terrains. For terrain like the gobi desert we have camels and we have learned to produce bicycles for some other places. We shall form these into military units that will able to fight where horses could not. At the same time we will train our cavalry to the highest degree of professionalism."
 MON_great_war_infantry_desc:0 "The great war brough in a large amount of new technologies and techniques. We haven't implemented many of them because we were not in that fight. The heroes that haven't been martyred will get some additional pay to do the speeches we write for them."
 MON_enshrine_war_heroes_desc:0 "Our generals, flying aces, even the humble soldier sacrificing himself for his squad. These military heroes are the core of the myth of our army. Making sure everyone knows about them will give everyone someone to look up to and emulate."
 MON_artillery_investment_desc:0 "To destroy our enemy with a projectile they can't shoot down, with our people far away, is the perfect weapon. We will steer our research to assure we are on the cutting edge of this wonderful technology."
 MON_great_size_cannons_desc:0 "After revamping our railway system we can now support giant train track guided artillery pieces. We've gotten our hands on an old one from the Soviets. While they are only to be guided on tracks, their shells are huge and can support our infantry. We will have to compensate for our lack of a modern fighting force, after all. Nothing else..."
 MON_increased_conscription_desc:0 "We need more people for the army, we will start conscripting great swathes of our men. This will come with a propaganda campaign to try and lessen the amount of forceful conscripting we need to do."
 MON_glorious_army_desc:0 "Our army has been reformed and reconstructed to be able to beat off and beat down any enemy. With the pounding of huge cannons that are able to calculate perfectly where to shoot due to gained intel, our troops will mow down whoever opposes us."
 MON_protect_from_the_threat_desc:0 "We are a small nation with only a couple of hundred thousand people in it. To assure we don't needlessly throw away lives we will erect great forts in which they will be able to mow down wave after wave of enemy soldiers."
 MON_supplying_troops_desc:0 "Our troops need a lot to keep going. Food, small arms ammunition, large shells, uniforms, shovels, new boots, water, pornography, drugs and other medicine. Getting all of this to the soldier and also having the soldier be thoroughly supplied in the first place is paramount! We will revamp our supply system to accomodate this."
 MON_scout_corps_desc:0 "Our military needs intel to know what to do, where and when. Using scout planes will allow us to know the enemy's movements. An informed soldier is a dangerous soldier."
 MON_ground_support_desc:0 "To our men on the ground, planes equipped to assist them are like angels. We will invest plenty to make sure rockets, bombs and other tools are equipped to our close air support planes to destroy the enemy from above and save our troops."
 MON_long_range_aircraft_desc:0 "There's plenty of situations where there's no allied airbase near the frontline, we will develop aircraft capable to support our troops and wage war from far away. No enemy will be beyond our range."
 MON_expand_aviation_institutes_desc:0 "We will expand our aviation institutes to include women, younger men and naturalised Mongols. People regardless of where they come from will be able to pilot these mighty machines and rain death upon our enemies."
 MON_intensify_pilot_training_program_desc:0 "Due to the lack of experienced pilots, we will have to increase funding to and pressure on our pilot training program. We may not have any aces or veterans, but trained pilots that know their left from their right will be a good start."
 MON_pilots_against_revolts_desc:0 "There's enough people, tribes and minorities, that are unhappy with how we do things here. Regardless of how they get their hands on their silly little rifles, our airforce will bomb them from the sky."
 MON_research_modern_navies_desc:0 "As a nation with a couple of great rivers we know what boats are, but the great navies of the foreign lands intrigue us. There's great navies on the pacific oceans, American, Japanese and Soviet. At least one of them might allow us to gain a little insight."
 MON_invest_in_dockyards_desc:0 "We will have to construct great dockyards to support our future goals in the pacific and beyond. These great places of employment will create our mighty fleet, ship by ship."
 MON_stockpile_fuel_desc:0 "We will have to be able to support our army and airforce for quite a while, even after war commences. Armed conflicts make export and import quite difficult. Fuel too will have to stockpiled and stored en masse."
 MON_mongolian_merchant_ships_desc:0 "Every nation with access to the sea needs a merchant navy. This way we can import and export goods and properly levy tariffs. Convoys are vital for that."
 MON_mongolian_marines_desc:0 "Our armed forces need to be properly trained if we want to be able to strike from our coast into other asian lands. If we could do that we can strike from our lands into Japan, China, eastern Soviet Union lands. Maybe even Indochina, Indonesia, or India."
 MON_the_old_school_desc:0 "We see no need to reinvent the wheel, great big ships with giant cannons is how it's done and that is what we'll make."
 MON_capital_ship_focus_desc:0 "[MON.GetLeader] has seen on a rare excursion to foreign lands how great capital ships can be used to bully weaker and smaller nations into submission. Pledging to never let that happen to Mongolia, it's been decided to focus on creating a ship like this for our navy."
 MON_carrier_focus_desc:0 "We are intrigued by the concept of airplane carriers. Great big ships that serve as mobile airports, allowing us to bomb enemy ships and units with impunity. [MON.GetLeader] has decided that this will be our focus for the navy."
 MON_carrier_fighters_desc:0 "We will need to develop planes that can go on the carriers we are planning. They will be able to strike far and land back safely on our steel behemoths."
 MON_khan_class_ships_desc:0 "Great mighty ships, with cannons bigger than buildings, are being created in our dockyard. These heavy ships will strike fear in the heart of even the most hardened enemy naval man."
 MON_prioritize_the_eagle_class_desc:0 "With our airfleet developed and ready, we will focus on getting these hunters into the air from the sea. Two great carriers will be commisioned to harass our foes across the ocean."
 MON_the_new_way_desc:0 "We've read much about lumbering battleships and heavy cruisers, this to us sounds like an easy way to bankrupt ourselves with haste."
 MON_undersea_combat_desc:0 "Our fresh and new fleet is too small to contend with large empires from a world away. We will need to focus on creating a fleet of underwater raiders that will slowly sap these behemoths of strength. The humble submarine is a perfect fit for a nation such as ours."
 MON_cruiser_submarines_desc:0 "Some of our enemies will be assaulting us from afar. We will need to sink their troop transports before they're well and far out of ports. A special type of submarine will be made, loaded with provisions and arms and be sent on the deep crusade into enemy waters."
 MON_midget_submarines_desc:0 "While our state will need to project power in the oceans, we can't afford to endlessly keep pouring resources into some fleet that might never be relevant. We will build small and cheap submarines to project threat on our shores without bankrupting ourselves."
 MON_surface_combat_desc:0 "Unfortunately we can't only hide under the waves. Some ships will have to escort our convoys from enemy submarines and other threats. Our destroyers will be these escorts that will bring our supply routes great safety."
 MON_improved_screen_ships_desc:0 "Some bigger ships will need to be constructed to protect our shores from naval bombardment. The coastal defense fleet will consist of cruisers that will lay in wait for a foolish fleet to get too close."
 MON_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "We will have to rapidly develop a coherent and comprehensive naval doctrine for in which manner we deploy this fleet we are developing. A fleet without the knowledge to use it will sink. Some of our young admirals will be assigned to develop one. "
 MON_mongolian_uranium_desc:0 "We have found a weird resource in our lands, deep underground. When we told the Soviets about this long ago, they were pretty giddy about it. Sure the machines they sent us for research do make a ticking sound when we bring them close to this green rock. Is that good? We'll find out soon enough." 
 MON_royal_guard_desc:0 "The Keshik, the 'favored' were were the imperial guard and shock troops for Mongol royalty in the Mongol Empire, particularly for rulers like Genghis Khan. We will reestablish this organisation. Instead of just being day bodyguard and night bodyguard we will give them positions in important military operations in our country."
 MON_state_police_desc:0 "We will need to secure our streets, people and organisations. Our state police has been established but will need to be given extensive executive powers to do their work and assure the loyalty of all."
 MON_secure_interests_desc:0 "Within our state we have organisations and companies that have considerable power; political or economical. We will stage a great operation to assure their loyalty to the state and to remind them that they are not beyond our reach. They will do our bidding or be destroyed."
 MON_one_leader_desc:0 "There's only one leader of our government. That position comes with power and perks that are well earned by such a powerful leader. [MON.GetLeader]'s strong hand has led us to glory and victory, and he shall do so forevermore!"
 MON_modern_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Modern Mobile Warfare"
 MON_ambitions_achieved_desc:0 "Our empire now spreads through much of Asia, the people once more united against western influence and under a strong Mongol leader. [MON.GetLeader]'s popularity is surging even further as we consolidate our holdings and prepare for the future. A future that, according to our great leader, will be as glorious as the empire of Ghengis from long ago."
 MON_deepened_security_desc:0 "Enemies have been shown to not only come from foreign lands but also from deep within. We will implement a state intelligence agency to keep us safe from without but mostly from within. This might possibly make Soviet interference a little harder as well, but it is vital to secure our rule from any threat."
 MON_help_the_spanish_desc:0 "Assisting our idealogical allies across the world is the duty of any member of an international movement such as communism. We will defend Spain against the onslaught of the fascist uprising in the name of solidarity and the worker's liberation!"
 MON_request_payment_desc:0 "Unfortunately we have to remind the Spanish that help is rarely ever free. While we might not have obtained the Spanish gold reserves, our currency has been based on silver in the past. Obtaining the Spanish silver will assist the Mongol state bank greatly."
 MON_purchase_buryatia_desc:0 "Buryats are a Mongolic ethnic group, sure they speak their own language but they will be glad to be returned to our lands. We strive to be a home for all Mongols, far and wide. If we haven't done any heinous things against their people, they should cooperate with us just fine."
 MON_fate_of_the_chairman_of_the_council_of_ministers_desc:0 "The chairman of the council of ministers, the said naryn zövlöl is our equivalent to the prime minister, and is the head of government. This position should, at any time, be a secure one within our government. With a steady hand and strong rule, without any major infighting."
 MON_invite_tanna_tuva_desc:0 "The USSR and us are the only nations in the world to formally recognise the Tuvan People's Republic. While we see Soviet influence in the nation rising, the Tuvans are a Turkic people with quite a present Mongol minority. Their workers would be more understood and united with us then our Russian brethren. We will reach out to [TAN.GetLeader] and offer them a union."
 MON_connect_the_infrastructure_desc:0 "In our union we wish not to be two seperate nations under one umbrella. We'll connect our industry and railways to make sure our people can freely work and integrate with one another. Tuvan people are now liberated workers in the People's Republic of Mongolia."
 MON_support_the_fight_desc:0 "All over the world, the fight for the liberation of the proletariat rages on. While we can't have boots on the ground in every conflict, we sure as hell can make sure a shipment of Mongolian rifles and some support equipment finds their way there. There's no need to thank us, we just need you to win and install a government of the people, for the people."
 MON_secure_the_administration_desc:0 "After all this upheaval we have to make sure there are no further dissidents, spies or seperatists in our administration. We will make sure everyone is loyal to [MON.GetLeader], no matter what."
 MON_intervene_in_the_region_desc:0 "There's a lot of tension, chaos and conflict in asia at the moment. Both large and smaller fights are breaking out. We might need to get involved in all of this to secure the liberty of the worker and secure our future."
 MON_liberate_the_chinese_desc:0 "Mao has some interesting ideas for someone who claims to be a communist. We believe Sheng Shicai to be the leader of the communist Chinese, and as his primary allies we are privy to claims on the entirety of China. The lands shall unite with us like the Yuan with old, but while that empire brought oppression and crimes against humanity, we will bring the uplifting of the worker's class."
 MON_divide_spheres_desc:0 "There already is a communist organisation in the south that is closely tied to the Chinese. It's probably better to establish diplomatic ties with them, if we are to agree on spheres of influence we could divide up the land in Asia to suit both our goals. While we do not trust Mao and his generals, we are aligned idealogically and should band together to liberate the Chinese people from fascist and imperialist forces."
 MON_free_the_south_desc:0 "In the south there lies a theocracy, a monarchy and all kinds of other imperialist dictatorship. We will dismantle the systems of their oppression and let the liberation of their proletarians commence. Through force if we have to."
 MON_soviet_cooperation_desc:0 "Working with the USSR is in our best interests, they dwarf us in military, political and industrial might. Regardless of how some of our people feel or felt about them, there is value in obtaining a peek under the hood of this communist machine."
 MON_lessons_soviet_army_desc:0 "There is much to learn from the red army, it is a large and well established force in the region with years of experience. We've also relied on them heavily when freeing ourselves of the khanate. Our government has opted to invite advisors and a few units to teach and drill our units. These new insights will serve us well."
 MON_fight_imperialism_desc:0 "to do"
 MON_siberian_project_desc:0 "Siberia is a wasteland, but it is one filled with proud people. Mongolic people, ethnic Siberians, Russians and more. We will work together with the Soviet Union to make sure this land will be able to actually support the people who live there. To create an environment worthy of the Union of Soviet Republics. We will put our people to work to improve infrastructure, set up supply hubs, and connect railways."
 MON_break_with_stalin_desc:0 "The creation of one man totalitarian police states and the theory of socialism in one country is just an another excuse to create a grand empire. [MON.GetLeader] has declared we will not sit around and wait to be incorperated into this disgusting excuse of worker liberation through worker oppression. This might come as a shock to our northern neighbour, but enough is enough."
 MON_state_farms_desc:0 "The sangiin aj akhui, state farms, were established in 1922 and their number has slowly been increasing over the years. As we develop large-scale grain and vegetable farming and import industrialized farming methods their numbers will sky rocket and secure a steady supply of food to be distributed by the state."
 MON_negdels_nokhorlols_desc:0 "We have recently replaced the forced collective farms and communes by production associations, called negdels in mongolian, and nökhörlöls which are voluntary cooperatives. In this manner the workers can pool their resources, influence and needs. This allows them to benefit from economy of scale and allows them to retain economic synergy."
 MON_communist_volunteers_desc:0 "People from across the world have flocked to our righteous banner. We are setting up foreign volunteer divisions as we in turn send volunteers across the world to intervene in the imperialist fight on the side of the just."
 MON_regional_ambitions_desc:0 "We have already secured some of our neighbours and are ready to take our place in the world stage as a modern and powerful communist state. Our ambition is to become the primary communist state in Asia. Combining the pan-asian movements with the liberation of the proletariat will allow us to powerfully propel ourselves towards dominating the region."
 MON_fair_representation_desc:0 "To assure the representation of minority groups we will reconfigure the Khural from an advisory body into a ruling body of state. This way all workers will be united in our state and there will be no favouritism. We will use this to quell resistance and align all towards our ambitions of a united Asian state."
 MON_mongol_empire_tt:0 "This focus will unlock the decision to recreate the Mongol Empire and grant you wargoals on the current owners of the required states."

 MON_asian_federation:0 "The Asian Federation"
 MON_asian_federation_desc:0 "An idea has arisen, instead of subjugating our fellow asian peoples we would like to band together and rise as one. By lifting each other up in one big Asian Federation, we can defend ourselves from any imperialist who tries to impose their will on us. Eastern or western ones, we will be safe."
 MON_lobby_imperialists_desc:0 "We know from experience that being a democracy comes with the weight of some pretty heavy ideals. We should strive to remind the great powers of the world about their ideals of liberty and democracy, the choice of the people."
 MON_centra_tt:0 "Your byproduct will be integrated into your industry spirit and both will gain buffs to create the centralized industry idea."
 MON_lobby_imperialists_effect_tt:0 "This focus will unlock decisions to give Asian puppets and colonies a spirit that gives them democratic growth and ticking autonomy. The overlord needs to be unaligned or a democracy."
 MON_asian_fed:0 "This focus will allow you to request to integrate Asian democracies that are in your faction."

#descs
 TIB_the_ratification_of_the_thirteenth_desc:0  "The ratification of the reincarnation of thirteenth dalai lama is done with the approval of the central government of China. Exempted from the lot-drawing process using the Golden Urn we have now a very young boy as our leader. His regent will have to steer our country until his ascendancy."
 TIB_advisors_to_the_dalai_lama_desc:0  "The young dalai lama has to be guided properly, groomed to become a great spiritual and physical leader. Many advisors will attend him, both biological family and wise men from close and far. We will have to pick the tutors wisely, for the wrong men can create a wrong man."
 TIB_truly_worthy_successor_desc:0  "With the unification of Greater Tibet our leader has proven himself a worthy successor to the thirteenth dalai lama. Our forces triumphant and our people adoring, this newfound popularity will allow us to cement our rule."
 TIB_the_regent_desc:0 "The Regent has been accused by critics of the of widespread corruption, and involvement with married women as a monk. This is clearly a horrid situation and we will have to assure the mind of the young dalai lama is not tainted. Wether it is the truth or a story, we will assure that only whatever is best for Tibet will happen."
 TIB_effective_government_desc:0  "With our army once more loyal and effective, our leader loyal and well advised. We are now an effective and modern theocracy. A noble has approached us to join us in this great time."
 TIB_improve_tibet_desc:0  "Tibet is no geat and modern nation, but we will work hard to make it so. Infrastructure and bureaucracy will need to be reformed to fit our leader and people's needs."
 TIB_secure_tibet_desc:0  "We will not allow Tibet to bend the knee to imperialist from east, west, south or north. Fortifications will sprawl our borders and nothing beneath the sky will disturb our peace."
 TIB_influence_bhuddists_nearby_desc:0  "There are nations around us filled with faithful bhuddists. By allowing ourselves to reach out to them and lobby for support, our govenment will be able to project considerable diplomatic reach into these local politics."
 TIB_religious_tensions_desc:0  "Rising religious tensions have caused us to gain considerable friction with the so far 'independent' minor nations surrounding us. In the sphere of India, we will raeach out to seek agreement in their rulership. The faithful should return to the flock."
 TIB_intervene_idealogically_desc:0  "In nearby countries, considerable groups of loyal faithful are being oppressed by the current controller of those lands. We will set up a program to militarily intervene on behalf of whoever we would prefer to rule those lands."
 TIB_liberate_bhuddist_people_desc:0  "We have had well enough of all these petty kings, generals and politicians around. We will allow them all to share underneath our banner and righeous guidance."
 TIB_fund_monastaries_desc:0  "Due to the remoteness of some of our monastaries some have fallen into disrepair. We will assure they are adequately funded and repaired to allow more and more people to follow us into enlightenment."
 TIB_chinese_border_raids_desc:0  "The forces of the Chinese probe our borders, trying to regain our loyalty. Never again will we bend the knee. We will strike out and do the same to them, their provinces will be ours. Liberating the Tibetan diaspora under us again."
 TIB_british_weapons_desc:0  "We have before gained British weapons to aid in the modernisation of our army, we will request them again. This will keep us a strong and useful buffer state between thei holdings and both the Chinese and the Soviets."
 TIB_foreign_research_desc:0  "Foreign researchers will bee able to aid us in the modernisation of our nation. Of course to what extent we will open up to them is up to us. Will we gain even more strangers in our mountains, or shall we reinforce our propaganda efforts?"
 TIB_large_tibetan_army_desc:0  "For our ambitions we will require a larger Tibetan army to be able to overcome our foes. We will expand our conscription to cover younger men, older men, maybe some women here and there. These conscripts will be trained and pressed into divisions to defend Tibet and the Tibetan people."
 TIB_outside_influences_desc:0  "Countries all around us are experimenting, democracy, communism, other things. Our people have become enamoured with the idea of a modern government. While we would never give an inch to the rabble, it is surely a thought to see what's out there and take the best parts."
 TIB_young_leader_tutor_desc:0  "The young leader's gotten some new tutors recently, a couple white men from a country far away called Germania? Maybe? Well they do know how the world works better than some of the old men around here. Maybe we should hear them out? Besides they are great men, and good climbers. How bad can they be?"
 TIB_lessons_of_the_empires_desc:0  "Many of the empires in the world have been felled by numerous attacks from inside their borders. We will address our own troubles by stomping down hard on the communist vermin trickling in from the Chinese stand-off across from our borders. We will also invest in our border police to shore up our defences against these agitators."
 TIB_populist_maneuvering_desc:0  "It's wonderful what a bit of 'us against them' will do. We have united the Tibetan people behind us by convincing them of a threat both weak enough to overcome and strong enough to be a threat, all around us. Within our country and without."
 TIB_align_nobility_desc:0  "Our nobility will have to stand with us, either thanks to bribes or thanks to threats. We will also cut through the endless miles of red tape by getting rid of the corrupt officials that lag our system down."
 TIB_mobilize_paramilitaries_for_offence_desc:0  "While we have a bit of an army, a lot of our forces are militias in the villages. We will try to mobilize them for the armed forces by recruiting them, nothing a bit of propaganda and some manufactured threats can't do. We will make up some attack on one of our institutions and they will flock to our banner."
 TIB_intervene_north_desc:0  "To the north lays the territory of some Chinese communist warlord who seems loyal to nobody. We will need to intervene before he becomes a threat to us and our way of life. With the people firmly behind us we will march in and take the fight to them. We will be home in mere weeks, the whole thing will come down just by our boots crossing the border."
 TIB_puppet_dalai_lama_desc:0  "The young dalai lama has been listening to us faithfully, while we currently need him to legitimize our orders, that will not be the case for long. If we would like to we could make sure he stays blindly loyal to us, no matter what."
 TIB_fascist_support_desc:0  "Fascism is the new movement and like any movement we grow stronger together. There are more of us across the world, we will send out word and plead for support from them. While Germany might be far away, a well whispered bit of the german tongue in the right ear will get us places. Even Japan could be swayed."
 TIB_weaken_the_jewel_of_the_crown_desc:0  "The jewel of the British crown? Drivel. India is a ethnic hotpot of different identities and backgrounds. By offering even the slightest lies and concessions we will be able to stir up a shitstorm in their lands, making it much easier for us to later calm these people when they arrive in our administration."
 TIB_strengthen_the_professional_army_desc:0  "Strengthening the professional army is vital for any kind of funcitoning state in these wild lands. Here? The law is force, at least for now. So we must be able to project said force through the means of our armed forces. We will make sure they are properly motivated to follow their orders."
 TIB_army_expeditions_desc:0  "Army expeditions will be set up for our forces to go experience life in a modern foreign nation for a while. This will be an ample opportunity to learn some things that we could use to improve our doctrines, maybe make somebody owe us a favor."
 TIB_nothing_is_free_desc:0  "Nothing is free in this world, and our forces do need to be paid. But when dealing with foreign governments it's easy to get rewarded for hard work. We will request our 'ally' to grant us some concessions. We won't be able to stretch them forever, but it'll help for a while."
 TIB_exploit_conquest_for_economy_desc:0  "We have conquered land, altough it's unruly habitans might not accept us as of yet as their rightful overlords it is ours to do with as we please. If we decide to move industry into an area where it stops getting bombed by rebels, then we will do so. No protests or complains will make a dent in our internal policies."
 TIB_an_army_with_an_economy_desc:0  "To make a mighty empire we need to expand our citizen's living space. Expansion requires soldiers, soldiers require arms. We will gear our economy and production to the benefit of the armed forces of our great nation. A strong army will help us prevail."
 TIB_the_military_coup_desc:0  "Due to our reforms and the military's recent success, a faction within the military that is striving for a more authoritarian, nationalistic and militant leadership. They have been empowered, wether intentionally or not, to grab it for themselves. This plan will execute with minimal casualties. Some people might not need to be purged, the dalai lama kid can stay, if he behaves."
 TIB_restructure_the_army_desc:0  "Now that we have a stranglehold over the political and economical power within the country, we can begin gearing everything towards becoming a stronger nation with a suited army. We will make sure our historical claims will be conquered by the mighty men of the Tibetan army!"
 TIB_mountainous_blitzkrieg_desc:0  "The mountaineer from Germany has told us of steel behemoths called 'tanks', which when supported properly could smash through any ranks. We have also heard of these being used by the Japanese and have become enamoured with them. We will train our army to use these modern tools of war."
 TIB_fuel_storage_desc:0  "To keep tanks going we need to be able to store great caches of fuel within our borders. We will set up the additional infrastructure required to get these projects done. The difference between a effective tank force and an ineffective one is only a couple more months of fuel!"
 TIB_further_training_improvements_desc:0 "We have been training our forces already but if we were to train all our troops to the standards of special forces around the world we could even stare down the British Empire's forces in a pinch. Ideal for our land grabs in India or in French Indochina."
 TIB_workers_for_industry_desc:0  "While we are pushing proud Tibetan men into service in our nations, some will need to work the factories and farms. The Hui, Tibeto-Burmans, Ningxia and Liaoning Hui peoples will be given these jobs. Everyone can work a wrench or plow, while only our strong men can defeat the Chinese hordes and arrogant Ghorka's."
 TIB_heerify_army_desc:0   "Our new government is prioritising being able to get our hands on western advisors to train our forces up to their standard. The army will no longer be mere militias but a trained force to swing the tides of battle in our favour."
 TIB_reclaim_the_empire_desc:0  "The Tibetan Empire was once a great empire centered on the Tibetan Plateau, not just restricted to it. Formed as a result of expansion under the Yarlung dynasty under Songtsen Gampo, we will see it's rebirth by invading China for our desired south eastern territories."
 TIB_cross_the_mountains_desc:0  "The Tibetan Empire spread south to reach the Indian ocean by Bengal. We will once again reconquer these lands and let our people eat all the fresh fish they desire. Nepal and Bhutan too will fall before us like cards against the breath of the Tibetan white tiger."
 TIB_south_east_asian_expansion_desc:0  "While the Tibetan Empire was our goal, we are not beyond further expansion. This time not Tibetan swords and armor but Tibetan firearms and explosives will lay waste upon their lands."
 TIB_western_ideas_desc:0  "The Dalai Lama's German advisors have been telling him about universities, scientists, professors and more. Finding this a novel idea, the young ruler has coaxed the regent into funding these programs, which has attracted another German to come over and help."
 TIB_whispers_among_the_downtrodden_desc:0  "The 'Ragyabpa', unclean have been whispering among themselves about liberation and 'heresy'. 'Deponb', descendents of ancient royal families should not be holding so much power, lording over us all. Especially with so many other peoples finding fleeing war and oppression to find more of it here there has been a true evolution in class conciousness..."
 TIB_invite_intellectuals_desc:0  "Inviting intellectuals to our nation to help modernise it, is an intriguing challenge to a lot of them. Sure, it isn't their most cushy option but we'll pay them well enough for their efforts. This will also open up more opportunities for advancing our production, construction or weapons."
 TIB_secure_border_desc:0  "We need to make sure the Tibetan people beyond our northern borders are secure. We will march in and intervene in their little uprising, making sure the government we prefer stays in power."
 TIB_request_support_desc:0  "The workers in our country can't defeat millennia of oppression by Chinese appointed nobility by themselves, they are weak, starving, and underequipped. We will reach out to likeminded governments in the region to see if they could lend us a hand."
 TIB_arm_chinese_communists_desc:0  "There is a nearby communist power laying in wait to become a superpower. As we are veering closer to communist leadership, we should use the refugees from these lands and arm them to fight in our struggle against the imperialists."
 TIB_merge_with_the_chinese_desc:0  "Phuntsok Wangyal has been convincing the members of our party to become one with the Communist Chinese, to become something greater, something more. There's many people's in China and we will be the government for them all, after we have gotten rid of the imperialists, nobles and western colonizers."
 TIB_spring_the_revolt_desc:0  "We are set up to start our fight against the oppressors. Most of us have gathered in the capital and we have become considerably stronger in our preparation, we will fan out after taking Lhasa and subdue the nobles camped out in the rural areas."
 TIB_the_fight_against_imperialism_desc:0  "Communist China has been fighting tooth and nail for it's existence, a widespread war has broken out now. It has to fight again, but it will not stand alone. We will join it to overcome this evil threat, once and for all."
 TIB_the_right_fight_desc:0  "We are doing the right thing and fighting the right fight. We will however, have to get from the west to the front in the east. Access to our troops will have to be given from our military allies."
 TIB_rail_to_capital_tt:0 "A railway will be built to your ally's capital from your own."
 TIB_cultural_revolution_desc:0  "It is vital for a nation after a violent transformation to not just win the people's hearts but to transform their minds as well. We will launch a sociopolitical movement that will transform the Tibetan people and politics by purging remnant of tehocratic and traditional elements from Tibetan society as much as we can."
 TIB_monastaries_into_prisons_desc:0  "We will turn monastaries into prisons, to reform offenders that haven't quite earned the bullet. Monks will become good and red workers, landowners will learn to plow what used to be their lands and former police officers will be forced to study our new laws. The bureaucractic system will be completely renewed and modernized too."
 TIB_radical_immigrants_desc:0 "With the liberation completed, many radical thinkers have flocked to our banner, even some considered to be too radical for most nations. We will shelter them and see if there's a thing or two we can learn from them."
 TIB_state_sponsored_meals_desc:0  "With our agriculture fully reformed, state sponsored meals will assist the workers that need it most. This system will be shared among all of our allied communist brethren, either with our food supplies or their own. This will help our workers perform even in the most dire of times."
 TIB_prisoner_conscription_desc:0  "These revalidated and now loyal communists are just sitting around, doing whatever menial task we throw at them. It is time to throw them at a martial task again, they will be pressed into service of the Tibetan military to fight our enemies for us. If they were to die they will recieve the same honour as any regular other soldier."
 TIB_asian_workers_union_desc:0  "We have been planning and working towards this for a while, we will create a better state, and greater worker's state. No longer restrained by national borders, ethnic lines, or geography. A worker's state for all Asians, liberated under our guise! Workers all over will welcome us with open arms."
 TIB_regional_cooperation_desc:0  "There's governments all around us that, while having differences with us in exact doctrine, are aligned in our wish for a world for workers. We will reach out to work with those that have supported us in our uprising and even those that have not."
 TIB_asian_communist_alignment_desc:0  "We will reach out another hand to the friendly governments in Asia to form a militiary pact. This will further align us together to fight for our goals."
 TIB_establish_red_snow_brigades_desc:0  "We will establish youth groups that will become the forefront of the revolution as it spreads from Tibet further into Asia. These motivated young men and women will be ready to strike down the traditional systems and drag the countries into the modern times, kicking and screaming if they must."
 TIB_infiltrate_red_snow_brigades_desc:0  "By infiltrating Red Guard Brigades into nearby countries, we will be able to get them in key positions to influence the nation they have become embedded in into our sphere. It might take a few months but we will allow the communist movements to grow inside their borders like the pressure on a rock before it cracks."
 TIB_secure_the_wakhan_corridor_desc:0  "Across the wakhan corridor lays Afghanistan, a possible ally as we take down the misguided Stalinists in the north. This Xingjiang buffer zone needs to go first, however. Then we can move on from there."
 TIB_liberate_central_asia_desc:0  "The Soviet Union has been oppressing Asian people for a long time, regardless of what it calls itself. We will have to march in and rescue the central asian people from it's Stalinist woes at the end of a bayonet."
 TIB_himalayan_peoples_union_desc:0  "The himalayan peoples are alike in many ways, it is vital for the viability of our nation to integrate it tightly into our worker's union. We will invest in the defence and industry of these new parts of us."
 TIB_cast_down_our_neighbours_desc:0  "We have threats all around us, at least we can't miss if we fire our weapons wildly in any direction. And that is what we will do. We will invade our neighbours for the sake of the oppressed workers everywehre."
 TIB_legalize_the_tra_desc:0  "We will legalize the existence of the Tibet Revoltion Party, or 'West Tibet Reform Association' as we call it in Tibetan instead of Chinese. A revolutionary, anti-feudal and more pro-republic of China party, it has been banned for a while. It is still a nationalist party which isn't actively seeking for us to be annexed by China, so they can't do too much harm."
 TIB_forward_guard_operations_desc:0  "While we can't be seen actively invading into a nation at civil war, we can definitely send some of our border police slightly further inward to assist the anti-communists."
 TIB_influence_dalai_lama_d_desc:0  "With the Dalai Lama being as young as he is, we will steer him towards caring about the political opinions of his people as well as their physical, mental and spiritual safety. This will make him extremely popular with the people too."
 TIB_divide_spheres_with_raj_desc:0  "The Raj has a near complete hold over the political choices of the other himalayan countries. We will reach out to them and promise to be great friends to them and their imperial overlords as a trade for some minor concessions; the transfering of these countries to Tibetan control."
 TIB_align_territory_desc:0  "With the himalyan territory fully under our control, we will align these states with ourselves. Railways will allow us to reach the place, and we will also have to invest in their industry as well. If they have any autonomy left and we have become a democratic government we will make sure theirs gets one as well."
 TIB_agitate_for_republicanism_desc:0  "A theocracy is best left to the catholics, we will agitate the government with a clear wish; secular political guidance. None of this populist friction between different religious groups, we are all Tibetan."
 TIB_constitutional_theocracy_desc:0  "We believe it's best to still guide the wellbeing of our people by keeping ourselves a spiritual nation, but we will allow the people to elect a political leader to guide us all."
 TIB_our_moment_to_strike_desc:0  "With China occupied, there's never been a better moment to attack the Chinese republic and their warlord cronies, reunite the lands of greater Tibet."
 TIB_monastaries_for_the_people_desc:0  "Our land is dotted with countless autonomous monastaries, we will open them up to allow people to seek learning and refuge in them. The monks can find meaning and zen within meaningful assistance to the community instead of only secluding themselves in silence. Altough if they can do their new job as mentors, teachers and docters in silence? We'll let them."
 TIB_modernisation_drive_desc:0  "Our country is in dire need of a load of modernisation, the bureaucractic system needs to be shaken up and reworked. Proper filing too. Our entire idea of what classes are too. Everybody who deserves anything good will be able to get it."
 TIB_the_fight_against_fascism_desc:0  "The fight against fascism is a righteous one, sure the Republic of China might have some irredentist tendencies, but at least it isn't Japan's pan-asian make-believe. We will fight tooth and nail to keep those imperialists on their island and far away from the himalayas or the shores of the Chinese sea."
 TIB_reaching_the_front_desc:0  "We are doing the right thing and fighting the enemy that will threaten our existence. We will however, have to get from the west to the front in the far east. We will need our allies to give our troops access and train rails will need to be constructed."
 TIB_republic_tibet_desc:0  "We have finally gotten enough support to proclaim the republic of Tibet. A parliament chosen by the people has been assembled to voice their concerns and keep us on our toes about the priorities of it's citizens."
 TIB_further_alignment_desc:0  "The political party of our current president has always been aligned with the Republic of China. It is time for us to reach out and tie our two countries together in a pact of cooperation and alignment, both economically and politically."
 TIB_business_with_warlords_desc:0  "The warlords in China are pretty much autonomous provinces, we will reach out to them to see what they can mean to us. We will have to make haste, while they still exist and get to make their own decisions."
 TIB_you_get_dockyards_tt:0 "You will get three dockyards in the coastal state."
 TIB_responsible_expansionism_desc:0  "Some people are in fact unhappy with their current administration and would be very happy to join us instead. We will reach out to these people and their government to see if we can broker some sort of referendum in those states. We will of course assure their safety and happiness."
 TIB_cast_down_the_thunder_dragon_desc:0  "The Kingdom of the Thunder Dragon, an antiquated state just past our borders. We desperately need to cleanse this backward stain of a place of it's traditions and bring it into the modern age."
 TIB_liberate_arunachal_pradesh_desc:0  "Arunachal Pradesh is a hotly contested area between the Indians and the Chinese, we border it as well. We will seize it from the Indians alongside any places of our interest."
 TIB_liberate_himalayan_people_desc:0  "We will need to liberate the himalayan people from the yoke of being what boils dotn to just another British puppet. While not officially one of their dominions or colonies, we will need to act quick if we want to make sure they stay far away from becoming a jewel in the English crown."
 TIB_collaborate_with_british_desc:0  "If we choose to collaborate with British Empire we could give them a hand in exchange for some prime real estate in the form of some of their Asian land. Burma for example looks rather nice this time of year and we will of course help them in their second great war."
 TIB_regional_pressure_desc:0  "We will exert pressure on regions nearby to make their government submit to a referendum. Of course we can always march in to enforce the will of the free people if they were to choose not to ratify a legal and official referendum."
 TIB_tibetan_law_desc:0  "With a Tibet government by the people's choice, the law will have to reflect the morals and wishes of said people. We will pen a great lawbook, representing all peoples within our borders."
 TIB_request_compensation_desc:0  "We can't possibly have fought in this war, lost thousands of men, for nothing. We will not be told goodbye with nothing much of a reward except some looted rifles and a few bucks. We will send for the governments controlling Greater Tibetan land and request compensation for our participation in this fight."
 TIB_a_safe_northern_border_desc:0  "A part of Greater Tibet is the area to our north, and while we might not initially have joined for that sake, we very much would like those lands to rejoin us. We will request them as a payment for services rendered. Our people will be liberated, finally. Through diplomacy even, unless they decline..."
 TIB_stem_refugee_flow_desc:0  "Stemming this constant inflow of Kazakhs, Turkic and Hui people's will be needed to stabilize our country, get it functioning again. There's only so much food to go around and we are in no shape to take care of all these others for now."
 TIB_internal_matters_desc:0  "Something is rotten inside the bureaucractic machine of Tibet, some are dying just because their requests and communications don't come through on time. We will really need to improve this situation if we are to have any semblance of a functioning country at all. Mobilize troops for example? How? We don't know where they even live! We could find out but it'd take us decades like this.."
 TIB_welcome_refugee_flow_desc:0  "It would be unethical and idiotic to refuse refugees from entering our country. These people are a great opportunity, as workers, soldiers but also as a reason to wage war against those that wronged them."
 TIB_no_stab_hit_if_crops_or_herds_tt:0 "You will not suffer this stability loss if you have completed the focus §Y'Subsidize our Crops'§! or §Y'Support Animal Herds'§!."
 TIB_religious_equality_desc:0  "There are some among us that don't follow bhuddist beliefs. Equality for them in the eyes of the law is the right thing to do and will also help us in gaining  with these people in conquered lands nearby."
 TIB_bhuddist_supremacy_desc:0  "Tibet is first and foremost a bhuddist country and ensuring that our religion will keep it's prominent position in our country will keep us strong and aligned with our history. It will also help us with the population of north eastern indian states..."
 TIB_a_feudal_industry_desc:0  "Tibet's industry is lagging far behind due to the entire system being pretty much just a feudal one. It will require a lot of work for it to become functional again. Of course the first step for that is to be getting some more factories up and running."
 TIB_arm_tibet_desc:0  "Tibet will require weapons to fight her battles, to arm her we will need to construct some military factories. It will pump out bullets, weapons that can house and shoot said bullets, maybe even a cannon or two."
 TIB_modern_state_academy_desc:0  "To catapult us into the future, we will need academics and highly educated people. For this purpose we will need schools, so that is what we will build. In these academies young Tibetans can become more than they have been before."
 TIB_oil_fuel_desc:0  "We will need fuel, not just to power our trains but also to power lights after we have electrified the country. Oil is as good as a source for fuel as any. We will drill deep and far to find a source no matter where."
 TIB_refine_coal_desc:0  "We have discovered that by refining coal, you can also create a sort of fuel, with all sorts of interesting byproducts. This will be good for the possible creation of trucks or even planes! We will set up some of these facilities around our mountains, maybe some idiotic enemies will think we are surrounded by volcanoes due to the smoke."
 TIB_resource_effort_desc:0  "To do nearly anything up this high we will need to work the mountains, drilling and blasting great holes into it. During one of our latest efforts to create a habitable environment we found some metals. We will need to research better and deeper drills and other extraction techniques to get this zinc, copper and lead above ground."
 TIB_resource_mining_alu_desc:0  "Bauxite mining will be vital for our country. This sedimentary rock has a high aluminium content, this light metal will allow us to create sturdy and lightweight things. This could bring us closer to airships, or even portable tools for our troops!"
 TIB_resource_mining_steel_tungsten_desc:0  "Mining and smelting to create steel and tungsten will allow us to ramp up production of artillery, guns, and even armored cars. We aren't quite sure what they are or how they will get anywhere in the mountains, but they sound quite impressive."
 TIB_putting_it_to_use_desc:0  "We have obtained the resources, it is now time to feed them to the great jaws of industry. Of course we will invest further into our industry to assure we aren't just going to sit here with a resource surplus that goes unused."
 TIB_dams_for_power_desc:0  "Hydroelectrics might be the best solution for us. Population has gathered around water sources anyways, so dams could generate power for these population centers. This way the electricity gets straight to the people that need it."
 TIB_production_modernisation_desc:0  "The modernisation of production could be the key to make sure our amy is equipped, our people are fed and spare parts are available where needed. For this we need factories, yes. But also a better way of working, a smarter way of working. Luckily we have developed it, with a little inspiration from abroad."
 TIB_production_scaling_desc:0  "Now that we have our production ready and set up, now we have to scale it all up. 'More' is a quality all of it's own. We need to do this is we want to not just have weapons and a bit of ammunition, but enough supplies to achieve all of our goals."
 TIB_modern_construction_desc:0  "Modern construction has alluded us for a long time, but with all these new techniques like cement mixing, we can finally achieve it now. With new building techniques, we can make bigger buildings, quicker. Sure they might not be as pretty but decoration can always be added later. "
 TIB_villages_to_cities_desc:0  "Turning mere villages into real city centers requires not just a lot of urban planning but also population controls. We will move some nearby villages into the new cities, allowing more remote villages in the rural areas to stay the way they are. Somebody has to feed the cities."
 TIB_electrify_country_desc:0  "Electrifying the country will be a great undertaking but it will bring many great comforts to the citizens of Tibet. Besides, factories and government facilities will be able to use it too. Phones, fridges, reliable light, the future is now!"
 TIB_reaching_places_desc:0  "Reaching locations in Tibet can be hard, it takes a long time and you have to really plan and bring enough supplies. But if we were to construct great railway projects, we can move people and cargo great lengths, without as much of a fuss. This will benefit everyone, greatly."
 TIB_tibetan_plateau_agriculture_desc:0  "Farming on the Tibetan plateau can be hard, due to limited arable land, livestock raising is the primary occupation on the Tibetan plateau. We will have to work hard to make sure farming becomes not just sustainable but a good job for all."
 TIB_opium_trade_desc:0  "The opium trade could bring us great benefit, since the initial opium wars many in Asia have become addicted to smoking opium. We can use that to pad our income to great extent."
 TIB_soldier_poppies_desc:0  "Opiates can be used for the suppression of pain, farming poppies can benefit our army if we were to produce painkillers with them. Of course they will be regulated and restricted, but it will allow our soldiers to fight harder and longer."
 TIB_centralize_farming_desc:0  "We will centralize farming, letting our administration decide what grows, where and when. This will allow us to scale our crop production and to allow co-ops to help each other get out of bad harvests and other failures."
 TIB_citizen_farmlands_desc:0  "We will allow our citizens to till the farmlands they were already working. Of course we'll redistribute some of the land a bit. Not just to show that we're the boss, but also to make sure only those loyal to the government obtain any semblance of power."
 TIB_subsidize_on_crops_desc:0  "To make sure our locally grown Tibetan crops afforadable for the people we will need to subsidize our crops. It will also keep the peasants content and loyal to their rulers. In whatever way that might be."
 TIB_support_animal_herds_desc:0  "We have made sure our farming has become viable, but now it is time to extend a hand towards the people tending to the herds. We can't make butter tea without yak milk, so we will make sure all of the animals get taken care of until their last breath. The people too, in whichever order."
 TIB_state_carpet_factory_desc:0  "Tibetan rug making is an ancient, traditional craft. Tibetan rugs are traditionally made from Tibetan highland sheep's wool, called changpel. While a state funded carpet factory might not be able to replace these traditional rugs, but it will make isolating the home more affordable for the poorer segments of the country."
 TIB_civ_economy_desc:0  "There's no point in improving our civilian economy to then just export everything. We will lower the amount of exports so we can keep enough of it for ourselves and our people. Export can be nice but we only have so many miles to invest the income in."
 TIB_factory_serfs_desc:0  "Well if we are going to have a large workforce of people at our leisure, we can put them to work for other state related benefits, like the army. These factories will be small villages in and of themselves, living quarters, mess halls and everything."
 TIB_cheap_labor_desc:0  "They used to be serfs, slaves almost. So we now have our hands on a workforce that doesn't quite know how to value itself yet. Cheap labour like this is paramount for building up our country, they'll get better wages once we have the industry running, of course."
 TIB_reform_the_system_desc:0  "Reforming the current labour system is vital for restoring the faith of the lowest classes in our leadership. It's the right thing to do. If this helps our government become more popular and have men flock to our banner to join the army? A nice side benefit."
 TIB_reduce_inequality_desc:0  "Reducing inequalities between what the classes used to be like, women and men, Tibetan or otherwise, will be what equalizes us all."
 TIB_land_reform_desc:0  "We desperately need land reform to change how the land ownership, use and transfer works in Tibet. Not according to noble families, or powerful connections. But according to what's right, what's smart and what's right."
 TIB_finish_the_reformation_desc:0  "Finishing up the reform scheme that we have been working on will be rewarding. The popularity of the ruling party has skyrocketed as well, and the people are happy and stable. Proud of their land and their people, they will fight for their right to keep it like this"
 TIB_you_will_unlock_industrial_concern_tt:0 "You will unlock the following industrial concern:"
 TIB_serfs_by_other_names_desc:0  "Serfdom gets a bad reputation, we will overhaul our indentured peasantry system to be more efficient. We'll call it something else as well, migration controlled laborers maybe? While more labor might mean less men for the army, we will put them right to work and it'll pay off in the longer term.."
 TIB_empower_specific_groups_desc:0  "A hierarchical system with leaders and folowers needs the strong and the mighty and the less fortunate. We have plenty of less fortunate within our borders, but we will need to empower the ones that will hold power. When we give them more power, they will become more loyal to our government, and keep the weaker ones in line."
 TIB_control_the_middle_division_desc:0  "The 'treba', taxpayers and 'dujung', householders are what we call the middle division. The middle division is who we need both loyal and oppressed. By allocating blame for their suffering on people outside our borders we will make them angry and ready to fight or work. This still keeps them weak enough that they won't rebel and they will fight only when we give them the tools and target to fight."
 TIB_keep_the_lower_division_placated_desc:0  "The lowest division is made up by 'ragyabpa', unclean workers, hereditary household servants and other serfs. We will keep them silent and ready to work. They can be a great asset to this country if managed and allocated properly."
 TIB_start_overhauling_army_desc:0  "The Tibetan army has a long way to go from the rabble with British rifles it currently is. While we will make sure to improve morale and pay, we also will set up a foreign training regiment where they go and fight real battles in real wars. There is no substitute for boots on the ground experience."
 TIB_issue_promotions_desc:0  "With our troops more motivated than ever and getting some real training in, it is important to issue promotions to ambitious and promising men that could be applying themselves well in higher positions."
 TIB_supply_improvements_desc:0  "It's hard to keep our troops supplied, not just because it is not easy getting around in the himalayas but also because it's sometiomes hard to source the uniforms, food and ammunition required by infantry. We will overhaul our supply system to allow for better provisions and aid i nthe time that our men need it most."
 TIB_engineer_corps_desc:0  "Setting up a modern engineer corps to practice the art, science and well, practice of designing and building military works can be paramount in fighting in these regions. Temporary roads, bridges and more can be installed to provide a great advantage over whatever enemy we face."
 TIB_fortification_focus_desc:0  "Fortifications are one of the eldest forms of military engineering, both this and siege warfare. For now we will focus on setting up great forts to protect our borders from any who dare probe them and harass our population."
 TIB_forward_engineering_operations_desc:0  "Sure, some engineering can be done by troops that are not in combat operations, but a select few will be elite as elite engineer divisions that will fight as tough as they construct. They will rain bullets and explosives on the enemy where once there was only rain, and when their corpses have been flooded away by physics of man or nature, we will reign victorious."
 TIB_a_cannon_to_shake_the_heavens_desc:0  "A cannon to shake the heavens, has been promised by our engineers. They will require a grand researching fortification, a lot of time and men, but they swear it can be done. An artillery piece so grand that it will require rails and trains to run them. Of course, this will all be for nothing if we don't have any or enough traintrack for it to run on."
 TIB_modernize_cannons_desc:0  "Some of our cannons are truly ancient, they will need to go through the process of modernisation. Bigger, more accurate and able to hit across miles of land. That is the goal."
 TIB_mountain_cannons_desc:0  "With the right spotters and communications, modern cannons can strike not just from mountains, but over them. From our capital straight into the hearts of the enemy our shells will rain."
 TIB_himalayan_mountaineers_desc:0  "Himalayan mountaineers have never been a common or even a mere rare sight. Reserved for the miniature armies of our southern neighbours, we will need to train our men extensively to not just be equal to theirs, but better."
 TIB_regular_patrols_desc:0  ""In a region as remote and inaccessible as the Tibetan Plateau, regular patrols are paramount. However, due to the limited training our personnel have received so far, patrols have been confined to villages and cities. We will train our men for as long as we need to allow them to patrol the mountaintops."
 TIB_mountain_cold_desc:0  "The mountain cold is a true killer. Long have we told stories and myths as warnings to keep our kids inside and our men back inside on time. But the cold is also an opportunity. To train our mountaineers extensively, to withstand and embrace the cold. An invading army unprepared for winter? Will surely fall and fail."
 TIB_finished_mountaineer_training_desc:0  "We have fininished developing the mountaineer training of our troops. They will be able to strike from banks of snows and frozen glaciers, climbing mountains high and swimming rivers low to strike deep into enemy territories. They will be terrifyingly effective, and ready to do exactly what we want them to do."
 TIB_professionalize_soldiers_desc:0  "We have had to rely for way too long on militias and need to professionalize our soldiers. We will disband the militas and create real fighting men from our recruits instead. No longer confined to the villages they grew up, they will fight where and when we want."
 TIB_former_militia_equipment_desc:0  "The former militia might not have had troves of equipment but they were also equipped by local nobles and sometimes even foreign governments. We will take great effort to safely and fully disarm all of them, the regional, local and national militias."
 TIB_professional_officers_desc:0  "Professional officers will be formed through training existing talent extensively in a school we will set up for them. They will learn foreign techniques and battle plans to complement the things they already know. We will make sure they follow our overal doctrine exactly as it is written."
 TIB_training_and_recruitment_desc:0  "Training and recruitment has always been a topic for the military forces in Tibet. We will have to press men into service to keep our conscription up and working enough to supply the units on the front with fresh unbloodied bodies. It might not be very popular, but we desperately need more men to fight the near unsurmountable armies of our neighbours."
 TIB_state_arm_factories_desc:0  "An army is only as strong as it's weakest rifles, state governed arms factories will supply our troops directly. While expensive to set up, this will allow us to cut through a lot of the supply issues that come from getting the rifles to an armory or supply depot."
 TIB_the_tibetan_soldier_desc:0  "The Tibetan soldier is a proud and strong one, ready to fight at a moment's notice, all throughout his motherland. Through training and experience these men are tough and spoiling for a fight. Rgyal kha nye bar slebs yod!"
 TIB_a_pain_to_invade_desc:0  "A country this high up? Mountainous? Invading it would be extremely costly, for anyone. Even a major nation wouldn't be as stupid as invade us, especially from multiple oceans away. The British might have to think twice if they decide that we would be a nice northern raj."
 TIB_rely_on_village_militias_desc:0  "Relying on village militias has always worked for us, it's a reliable source of manpower and they usually come with their own small arms. Sure they're usually muskets so they are due replacement, but the loyalty to their village and their willingness to fight usually pays off."
 TIB_centralize_local_armament_production_desc:0  "Village militias have usually sourced their own arms from local workshops and craftsmen, or bribing border guards on both sides of the border. Centralising this system to be coherent and properly paid for would get us a steady supply of arms without risking any diplomatic incidents."
 TIB_local_command_autonomy_desc:0  "Local commanders have always led the militias they raised and often grew up with. They references and experience in thee area will make them deadly foes if we allow them the autonomy to execute their orders as they please. Their inside jokes and crude comments might be distracting sometimes but the men are fiercely loyal to them. And we can't put a price on that."
 TIB_irregular_groups_desc:0  "Irregulars are just another term for militias, private armies, mercenaries. These kinds of skirmishers are rife in Tibet and pressing them into official paid government service might be for the best. We're sure we can find some more of these in local states."
 TIB_steady_supply_ammo_desc:0  "A steady supply of ammunition is vital to keep our troops firing in the right directions. Especially with our reliance on these ragtag forces it can be hard to supply them due to them all being armed with a very varied group of arms. We will set up factories to produce a range of ammunitions, even for weapons we don't produce ourselves. Nobody ask private Chöphel where he got that machine gun..."
 TIB_a_prepared_state_militia_desc:0  "A prepared state militia is better than no forces at all. While we certainly have a lot of different branches of infantry. It'll be extremely hard for some huge country to invade us if every citizen might have a gun here or there. These armed citizens will fight tooth and nail to defend their home."
 TIB_increase_conscription_desc:0  "We will need to aggressively up our conscription, now that we can finally figure out where people live. The bureaucracy was a pain to navigate around, but now we will have the means to find young and able bodied men to push a rifle onto."
 TIB_the_air_corps_desc:0  "Mountains high, armed forces higher. That seems like a dream, but it could be a reality. We will send out our men to train in foreign lands, fly foreign planes. This practice will come in handy when we have planes for them to occupy."
 TIB_guard_to_the_sky_desc:0  "Guarding our people from foreign airforces is vital, our people need to live unbothered by enemy bombs. The sy will become grey with lead the second someone dares to invade the peace of the himalayan peaks."
 TIB_state_transport_planes_desc:0  "It's the responsibility of the state to be able to supply our people everywhere. Some villages are so remote that transport planes might be the only option to resolve their plights. A state sponsored program will be set up to address these issues."
 TIB_mountainous_paratroopers_desc:0  "Special forces that can redeploy quickly throughout the mountains might be the key in putting the fight to the enemy. Training these men will be a long and hard process but it could help us greatly. Like eagles from the sky they will fall upon the enemy worms, their lives snatched up in moments."
 TIB_expand_the_aircraft_infrastructure_desc:0  "The aircraft infrastructure will have to be expanded from virtually nothing to a thriving manufacturing center for planes that can roll right up on the airbase. Of course we can just retool the factory to start pumping out hunting rifles when these troubling times are over."
 TIB_modernize_aircraft_facilities_desc:0  "Centralizing all airbases in one place is a good way to get them bombed out and rendered inoperable. We will place them down in every state where the local populace isn't going to immediately bomb the things themselves. A couple cannons next to them will keep them safe from threat above."
 TIB_import_foreign_planes_desc:0  "Importing foreign planes is the easiest way to get proper flying vehicles in our people's hands. Maybe it won't be fast or cheap, but it will be easy. We will have to rely on the market of course, but we aren't afraid to spend into the right hands and stuff the right pockets."
 TIB_licensed_production_desc:0  "Licensed production could be the key to get solid plane designs ready to be made in our factories. They will be real Tibetan planes anyways, just without the expensive, extensive and slow research and development that goes into homegrown ones."
 TIB_increase_domestic_aircraft_development_desc:0  "Our factories soiled by planes that aren't researched by Tibetan men and women? We would rather fly rocks through the sky. Domestic aircraft development is the answer to the aircraft question. We've got scientists eager as anything to start learning about aerodynamics, whatever that is."
 TIB_fund_flying_schools_desc:0  "Funding flying schools will allow us to get rid of any ill beliefs and superstition that they might have picked up in their training in other countries. Training will be improved as well, to create better pilots."
 TIB_intensify_pilot_training_program_desc:0  "Intensifying our pilot training program will allow us to form a truly professional and ready airforce that will be ready to trade wins with even the British or Japanese if need be. Smarter use of fuel will be good for our use of resources. Improving our doctrine will make our air missions efficient."
 TIB_expand_aviation_institutes_desc:0  "Expanding this little training program to become proper institutions of our country won't be easy, but with enough bribes and defectors, we can form a teacher regime of former foreign pilots. Of course, in time we'll replace them with our own. We've also discovered it's light work, so we are now allowing women to replace able bodied fighting men."
 TIB_ground_support_desc:0  "Planes help, but ground battles win wars. Ground support planes are the future of battle, able to bomb the enemy from up close, allowing our troops to move in. No symphony more sweet than that of soldier and airman working together in harmony. We will research whatever we need to make these a reality."
 TIB_long_range_aircraft_desc:0  "Big and heavy airplanes, the size of dragons. Bombing out the enemy's industry, homes and capabilities to feed their troops. It'll be devestating for ourt enemy, but that is none of our concern."
 TIB_experimental_planes_desc:0  "Experimental designs have popped up in our labs, we don't know which of the mad bastards have been making them, but we have decided to fund them in a new facility. Also the Japanese are sending planes into ships? Why don't we strap some explosives to some flying things and have them hit some prime bases."
 TIB_research_modern_navies_desc:0  "Researching modern navies might come in handy when we get settled in a state close enough to a sea. Both ships themselves and doctrines will have to be developed in due time. Maybe even in preparation?"
 TIB_invest_in_dockyards_desc:0  "Well we might not have many coastal states, but we will have to make it count. By investing in the construction of some dockyards we will able to create ships to project some level of naval strength. Mostly to keep enemy troops from landing on our shores, of course."
 TIB_stockpile_fuel_desc:0  "To keep our planes going we need to be able to store caches of fuel within our borders. We will set up the infrastructure required to get these planes in the air. The difference between a effective airforce and an ineffective one is only a couple more months of fuel!"
 TIB_TIB_merchant_ships_desc:0  "Tibetan merchants will have to use whatever they can, ships down to rivers for example. We can use them to trade for resources or other goods. Both the arms market and the steel markets will greatly benefit us all. It will feed the war machine after all."
 TIB_TIB_marines_desc:0  "Tibetan marines? It sounds ridiculous but we will have to build some sort of capability to land troops onto enemy shores. Of course we will have to start by teaching our men to swim. Preferably with their equipment and well enough to save someone else who isn't as well equipped to handle the vengeful waters."
 TIB_invest_in_modern_navy_desc:0  "Investing in a modern navy means building ships, fast. Good ships too, altough everyone's definition might be different. We will train some landless peasants to become expert shipbuilders, no mere unskilled labour for them. Not anymore."
 TIB_undersea_combat_desc:0  "Undersea combat sounds ideal. We will be invisible and indivisable. A way to fight without the enemy being able to fight back? With minimal risk of casualties? Sure our conscripts might not be used to not being able to see large mountains close around them, but steel shells might not be that different."
 TIB_cruiser_submarines_desc:0  "Cruiser submarines could strike far away to the shores of whatever continent the enemy comes from. They will feel all comfortable and will not be patrolling their waters that aggressively."
 TIB_midget_submarines_desc:0  "Smaller submarines that we can cover the entire ocean floor with would be perfect. If any of them got sunk, we will suffer minimal losses, and they are pretty cheap to make. Of course they will have a lessened impact on the battle but hey, a torpedo still blows up if the boat it comes from is small."
 TIB_surface_combat_desc:0  "Even on the surface we will have to fight, fight to keep our waters clear of enemy submarines and fight to keep the convoys coming in. Of course we'd prefer not to run into any battleships, but we won't flee neither. With enough guns, any behemoth will fall."
 TIB_improved_screen_ships_desc:0  "Improving our coastal defense ships will keep our land clear from any shenanigans the enemy might launch at us from the seas. This of course is worth investing in. We have acquired some designs from overseas which has made our captains and admirals giddy with anticipations. It'll take months to pump these babies out, but they will be as happy as the mother of a newborn child."
